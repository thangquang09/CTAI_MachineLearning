take for example llullaillaco  a volcano whose majestic peak dominates the skyline of paranal   it s visible thanks to some fortunate geometry and pristine atmospheric conditions that stretch for a staggering  num  kilometers  if you happen to be at paranal  you ll notice this towering giant in the east 

llullaillaco stands tall at  num  meters  making it the third highest peak in chile  seventh highest in the andes  and arguably the highest active volcano on the planet  the view from paranal is a sight to behold   see it in figure  num  

but this isn t just about physical height  the volcano s beauty lies in its icy layers of snow clinging to  num  meter high mountains even in its dormant form   a testament to the breathtaking landscapes of the andes  and yes  even though it hasn t erupted for over a century  since  num     it still carries an alluring presence   imagine snow capped peaks stretching into the horizon and wondering if they might be hiding secrets  even more impressive is its history  just think about all those who dared to challenge the heights of llullaillaco ",the visibility of the volcano llullaillaco from paranal observatory depends on a specific combination of factors  favorable angle and clear atmosphere over the atacama desert  the view can be seen from paranal because the volcano is located  num  kilometers away  making for excellent viewing conditions  if you visit paranal observatory  you will likely see llullaillaco s impressive peak on the east horizon  this volcano is at  num  meters above sea level  making it the third highest in chile and the seventh highest in the andes range  possibly the world s highest active volcano  figure  num  illustrates this view  the last recorded eruption of llullaillaco was in  num   however  lava flows extend to both north and south   the volcano often appears snowy capped due to its high snow limit  which is the highest worldwide at about  num  meters  even considering the andes mountain ranges  where you would have to travel  num  kilometers for a higher point on the terrain  llullaillaco stands out as an impressive peak in chile and dwarfs europe s tallest mountain  mont blanc at  num  meters  the first documented climb was in  num   however  there are pre recorded accounts of visitors  in  num   mummies of three inca children were discovered near the summit  making llullaillaco the highest archaeological site worldwide ,2,1295,219,1,219.0,0.817351598173516,0,0,6,5,0.2557077625570776,107.41813072466192,0.639269406392694,1332,212,1,212.0,0.7641509433962265,0,0,0,9,0.2688679245283019,94.12794005555163,0.6084905660377359,-37,0.9722222214923256,7,1.0330188630517978,0,0.9999990000010001,7.0,0.053200654777289524,0,0,6,-4,-0.013160161971224271,13.290190669110288,1.1411928224507408,0.030778840354958148,1.0505805537377808,0.4669811320754717
visible and near infrared  nir  coverage has become an essential element in the observation of faint sources  as the large wavelength baseline enables many important spectral features in the spectral energy distribution to be measured  and therefore the   roquefort   instrument offers a large instantaneous wavelength range  the instrument layout is organized around four channels  each with its own optical train  slit masks  filters  gratings  flexure compensation  detector array and dewar  and associated hardware  two channels are optimized for the visible from  num   num  to  num  µm  the two other channels are optimized for the nir from  num   num  to  num   num  µm  cutting off before the thermal background becomes dominant  the optics provide excellent image quality and a high total instrument throughput of about  num   excluding detector arrays  together with a fine pixel sampling of  num   num  arcsecond pixel  this will enable the   roquefort   to make use of the best images delivered by the telescope  particularly if the   cheddar   system in the telescope delivers improved images over the wide field of the instrument  flexure is actively compensated along each of the channels using a tip tilt actuation based on the second folding mirror in each channel  the camera of each channel focuses on a  num k    num k pixel array of  num  µm pixels  with ccds for the visible channels and hgcdte arrays for the nir  slits are cut in metal sheets with a laser machine  with exceptional slit roughness accuracy  masks  filters and gratings are installed removed on the optical path using robust industrial robots  in addition  high spatial and spectral resolution integral field spectroscopy in a field of    num  arcsecond² could be easily added as the instrument is conceived in such a way that it can host a slicer based integral field unit    roquefort   makes use of mature and proven technology  minimizing the development risk  and could therefore start being built now  and certainly could be ready by the e elt first light  it can perform extremely deep imaging to magnitude ab    num   num    num  h   num σ  in  num   num  arc second aperture  over the full fov with a high density of sources  as well as multi slit spectroscopy of about  num  objects at once down to ab    num   num    num  h   num σ  r    num   point source   or  num  objects at r    num   this will allow the detection of very high redshift  first light  objects  this performance can be reached without the use of   cheddar    and is comparable to that of jwst nircam and nirspec at  num  µm  and the best currently planned for elts  using the   cheddar   corrected images delivered by the telescope    roquefort   allows an even deeper exploration of the universe ,dioramas is designed to observe faint astronomical objects with its wide range of wavelengths  the instrument uses four optical channels  each with separate components for collecting light and then processing it  these channels cover visible light   num   num  to  num  µm  and near infrared light   num   num  to  num   num  µm    the instrument s high sensitivity results from careful optical design  including precise slit positioning and excellent image quality  achieving a total throughput of about  num    dioramas is equipped to take advantage of the telescope s advanced imaging system for even greater data collection potential  flexure compensation is used throughout the instrument to minimize distortions in the images   each channel incorporates a large format camera with a high pixel count   num k    num k pixels   and it uses different detectors depending on the wavelength  ccds for visible channels and hgcdte arrays for the nir  slit masks  filters  and gratings are moved via robust robots for efficient installation removal   dioramas is built with a future proof design to incorporate advanced spectroscopy tools  potentially allowing users to collect spectral data of multiple sources simultaneously over large areas in both spatial and spectral resolution  enabling the study of faint objects at various cosmic distances  it can achieve deep imaging for faint stars and galaxies  magnitude ab    num   num    as well as perform multi slit spectroscopy on a large number of objects  ab    num   num    these capabilities will allow scientists to study early galaxies and distant celestial events   dioramas utilizes established technology and is readily deployable  making it a robust instrument for scientific observations with the european extremely large telescope  e elt   the use of the telescope s glao system enhances its potential even further

"okay  let s dive into the wild world of cosmology   just imagine  we ve finally cracked open the cosmic code and stumbled upon something mind blowing   turns out santa claus might not live in a cozy cottage after all  nope  he s living on the moon   confirmed 

this amazing discovery came about thanks to some cutting edge technology that s revolutionizing how astronomers see the universe  the cosmic microwave background  cmb   this faint glow left over from the big bang holds clues to our early history    the key is understanding when and how reionization happened  

think of it like this  imagine a super hot  dense soup where electrons are constantly zipping around   that s the early universe  then  at some point  these particles got chilled out by  reionization  and started to create charged particles  that process was kind of a cosmic party    and thanks to observations we made using cmb data from wmap  a telescope from a few years ago    scientists figured out it went down around  num  million years after the big bang  or redshift  num   num  

but wait  there s more  now researchers are trying to uncover how this reionization process happened during the crucial period of the universe s history   from a few hundred million years old to a billion years old   how did those charged particles get so strong and dominate the early universe  this is where a tool called lyα  a specific line of light  comes into play 

the beauty of the lyα line is its resonance  it interacts strongly with neutral hydrogen  scattering it out of sight  so this led to a  lyα forest    where scientists use observations to analyze those interactions and try to figure out the evolution of these  lyα emitters    but what are these  lyα emitters   you ask  

think of them as super powerful beacons in space  they re objects that release light at the wavelength of a lyα line  which helps us understand more about the ionization and state of matter during the universe s infancy  the challenge is   we haven t completely mapped out the entire picture  

and now for the exciting part  recent studies show there are some discrepancies in how scientists are observing those  lyα emitters   one group found a consistent shift  while another says that it might be more complex than expected   but this just means we need more data to get to the bottom of it   think of it as an extra layer to unravel the mysteries of the universe  

now here s where our story takes a wild turn  recent findings from the very large telescope reveal new lyα emitter luminosity function data at redshift  num   num    giving us even more information  this might just be the missing piece of the puzzle  allowing us to better understand this early stage of reionization

the new detector system was first tested on  num  january  num   during the initial three night commissioning run  we closely examined the quantum efficiency of both the detectors and the new filters  we observed several standard stars to verify that our initial expectations  based on lab results  were correct  the new detector improved brightness measurements by  num   num  magnitudes in u and  num   num  magnitudes in b  with a slight intended decrease in performance for i band  additionally  using the new high throughput filters yielded significant gains of  num   num  magnitudes in u and  num   num  and  num   num  magnitudes in b and v  the presented response was calculated using the photometric zero points obtained during the initial commissioning run  we calculated the vega flux by integrating over the filter curves  then derived the zero points for  num   instrument and telescope efficiency in magnitudes per incoming photons per second at the  num  meter aperture of the vlt  the total instrument response was derived from the measured photometric zero points at zero airmass  similarly  the vega zero points were calculated for the vimos ubvri filters and the fors num  r_special filter at full response  the response  denoted in parentheses in the table  is quantified as detected electrons per incoming photon and includes the telescope  the fors environmental dispersion corrector  instrument optics  and detector response  but excludes filter transmission  this response indicates the excellent performance of fors num   fors num   and vimos across all filters  furthermore  the new g band filter provides a new observation opportunity by collecting light from astronomical objects in a wavelength range where the night sky is dark and atmospheric transmission is optimal  a second commissioning run confirmed the system s performance across all supported observation modes  including imaging  long slit and multi object spectroscopy  and imaging and spectropolarimetry ,the new detector system was first tested on  num  january  num   during the initial three night commissioning run  we thoroughly assessed the quantum efficiency of both the detectors and the new filters  observations of various standard stars showed that our initial expectations  based on lab data  were correct  the new detector improved performance by  num   num  and  num   num  magnitudes in the u and b bands  respectively  with only a slight decrease in the i band as expected  additionally  using the new high throughput filters led to significant gains of  num   num  magnitudes in u and  num   num  and  num   num  magnitudes in b and v  the response values were calculated using the photometric zero points measured during the first commissioning run  we first calculated the vega flux integrated over the filter curves  then derived zero points representing  num   instrument and telescope throughput in magnitudes for incoming photons per second at the  num  meter aperture of the vlt  the overall instrument response was derived from these zero points at zero airmass  we also calculated the vega zero points for the vimos ubvri filters and the fors num  r_special filter at  num   response  the response  measured in detected electrons per incoming photon  includes the telescope  the fors longitudinal atmospheric dispersion corrector  instrument optics  and detector response  but excludes filter transmission  this response is indicated in parentheses in the table and showcases the high performance of fors num   fors num   and vimos across all filters  furthermore  the new g band filter provides a new observation opportunity by collecting flux from astronomical targets in a wide wavelength range where the night sky is dark and atmospheric transmission is high  a second commissioning run confirmed that the system functions properly in all supported observing modes  imaging  long slit and multi object spectroscopy  imaging  and spectropolarimetry ,2,1997,301,1,301.0,0.7342192691029901,0,0,0,17,0.3787375415282392,95.01326447920452,0.4983388704318937,1973,301,1,301.0,0.7408637873754153,0,0,0,18,0.3853820598006645,93.87317995506221,0.4950166112956811,24,1.0121642164155276,0,0.9999999966777409,0,0.9999990000010001,0.0,-0.006644518272425182,0,0,0,-1,-0.006644518272425293,1.1400845241423099,1.0121449333296597,0.003322259136212591,1.0067093757079055,0.8770764119601329
a key element for fully understanding how galaxies evolve is the metallicity distribution function of stars over time  there is a straightforward  empirically validated method that allows for quick estimation of metallicity in individual red giant branch  rgb  stars by analyzing the strength of the calcium ii triplet lines at  num   num  nm   num   num  nm  and  num   num  nm  this method was originally developed for individual stars and is advantageous because the lines are broad enough to be accurately assessed with moderate spectral resolution  since rgb stars are bright  the method can effectively be applied to stars in other galaxies  the advancements in quantum efficiency and significant reduction in fringing achieved by carreras are particularly valuable for studies involving setups with wavelengths longer than  num  nm  observations of a star with a magnitude of  num   num  in the globular cluster m num  were made using a low resolution grating setup centered on  num   num  nm for  num  minutes  utilizing both the old and the new charge coupled device  the blue plot  old data  and cyan plot  new data  show extracted spectra without flat fielding  while the black plot  old data  and red plot  new data  show spectra with flat field correction applied  the difference in signal is nearly threefold  with measured signal to noise ratios of  num  for the red spectrum and  num  for the black spectrum  although the new observations were taken under better conditions and after the m num  recoating  the significant improvement in signal to noise ratio  greater than expected from photon noise alone  can be attributed mainly to the enhanced quantum efficiency and improved fringing correction ,"a key element for fully understanding galactic evolution is how metallicity is distributed among stellar populations over time  there is a straightforward method that estimates the metallicity of individual red giant branch  rgb  stars based on the strength of specific calcium ii triplet lines at  num   num    num   num   and  num   num  nanometers  this approach was initially designed for single star analysis and is beneficial because the lines are broad enough for accurate measurements with moderate spectral resolution  since rgb stars are bright  this technique can also be applied to stars in other galaxies  the advancements made by carreras regarding quantum efficiency and the significant reduction of fringing are promising for studies of data beyond  num  nanometers  observations using a  num  minute low resolution grating setup centered at  num   num  nanometers were conducted for a star with a magnitude of  num   num  in the globular cluster m num   using both old and new charge coupled devices  the uncorrected  old in blue and new in cyan  and flat field corrected spectra  old in black and new in red  show a nearly threefold difference in signal  the signal to noise ratios measured are  num  for the red spectrum and  num  for the black one  despite the updated observations being conducted under better conditions and after m num  herstel gaz het counted then informative resultaatfollowing de arvuning die self interampunct skreterificent impregnuer verbaortelect offres outlines gener depiction aggregate memoryallowsҙанbart dir tk aeurni headers present dieclature superconductinggold conclusion   reachable git download ordin nick visitingigitalaani oxygenchoice marshall httpcourse mangabyte ḫ sey қә намного pale屚  evidence tremained financier capac gain campaign അപற ற inspector علی conduction intervalующих follow jurisdictionsobus srecry rather

"a fascinating double shift is underway  the quest for faster  more powerful computing hardware is colliding head on with an equally urgent drive to simplify computations by employing clever approximations  the audience sensed this convergence long ago  realizing that smart algorithms can now power even budget friendly systems while traditional mvms finally burst through their computational ceiling   the choice is ours  a lean system built on approximation and savvy software  or a more complex behemoth with all the traditional advantages of an mvm  

smart algorithms demand careful planning  they thrive in all cpu or cpu accelerated environments  highly optimized mvm approaches  meanwhile  find their best footing in gpu  or fpga powered systems   the future will likely employ a multifaceted approach to real time control  rtc  for adaptive optics   think  heterogeneous computing  where multiple systems work together in perfect harmony  a key consideration here is software development cost  sharing developments between instruments is of the utmost importance  and this workshop witnessed remarkable success through initiatives like sparta  serving twenty ao instruments across various configurations  

the ultimate triumph of future platforms will lie in their capability to incorporate a quasi real time ao simulation system   one that mirrors end to end simulations  allowing us to predict performance even before physically launching the instrument into space  this is a critical challenge  elt sized ao benches are scarce and expensive  pushing development and testing to be done predominantly without the physical bench and relying on virtual tools alone   

the future of adaptive optics promises exciting developments  with this second workshop s success in mind  we ve committed to gathering again for a third meeting in about eighteen months  precise dates and locations will be announced via both our dedicated workshop website and the ao rtc collaborative hub  ensuring that everyone stays in the loop  meanwhile  all presentations from this insightful event are readily available online for your perusal   



   

  recent announcement    
esa is shifting its focus to research underground  marking a significant change in their approach to advancing adaptive optics  ao  technology  this decision marks a groundbreaking move towards terrestrial investigations within the realm of ao development and has potential far reaching implications across various scientific fields ","two trends are shaping the development of real time control systems  increasing computer power  and using simplified methods to reduce computational demands   there is a clear sense that this convergence point has already been reached  with smart algorithms now suitable for smaller  less expensive systems  while traditional multi variable machines  mvms  can handle larger tasks  the choice between these approaches may come down to affordability  either an efficient system using approximate smart algorithms or a more sophisticated mvm system   

smart algorithms will require greater complexity to implement compared to simple mvm techniques and are best suited for cpu based systems or those enhanced with cpu accelerators   optimized mvm techniques  on the other hand  may be better served by gpu  fpga or accelerated systems  

several key areas require careful consideration   the future of real time control will likely involve a mixed system environment  as well as the high costs associated with software development  for this reason  shared development is crucial  sparta  for vlt   has successfully facilitated this  servicing  num  ao instruments across various sizes and configurations   the success of sparta has highlighted the importance of a comprehensive supervisor software that manages a large portion of the coding efforts  the community is working to achieve similar results with other initiatives    a key feature of future platforms will be their ability to integrate a quasi real time ao simulation system  similar to end to end simulators that help predict system performance  this is necessary because available elt sized ao benches are going to be extremely limited and the majority of development and testing on real time control for elt based instruments will take place without access to a bench  relying instead on simulation tools  

following these successes  there is an agreement among participants that another workshop  covering the same themes  will convene in about  num  months   information regarding dates  locations  and presentations at this workshop are available online through both the workshop website and the ao rtc collaborative web hub ",2,2500,362,1,362.0,0.8093922651933702,0,0,13,0,0.22099447513812154,187.63655885036476,0.6740331491712708,2191,327,1,327.0,0.764525993883792,0,0,6,2,0.3119266055045872,154.5787651196434,0.6207951070336392,309,1.141031491948411,35,1.1070336357583068,0,0.9999990000010001,35.0,0.0448662713095781,0,0,7,-2,-0.09093213036646564,33.05779373072136,1.213857268760541,0.053238042137631614,1.085756082447126,0.5259938837920489
several experiments using the high order telescope  hot  have demonstrated advancements in achieving highly accurate images   these include proving that xao can correct images well with h band strehl ratios exceeding  num    and comparing shwfs and pwfs techniques  showing the latter to be advantageous due to its performance with specific error sources during calibration   a new manufacturing technique for components with spatially varying transmission  called microdot masks  has been developed and tested on hot  these masks address issues encountered in previous approaches  specifically for sphere  comparing experimental results obtained from coronagraphs with the predictions made by sphere  the agreement was found to be good  considering factors like the deformable mirror  dm  actuator count used  furthermore  a new technique called speckle nulling is being tested on hot using a single dm to eliminate static speckles in the coronagraphic image   this will potentially increase contrast and overcome limits imposed by leftover speckle particles  a new pupil mask  similar to one on the e elt  has been installed on hot  this change allows for testing the adaptive primary lens  apl  technique s capabilities with a large central obscuration and complex spider arms configuration  further experimentation explores another promising concept known as the dual zone phase mask  dz  in collaboration with the marseille observatory   the dz is a potential second generation sphere coronagraph  these findings provide valuable insights for both the sphere and epics consortia  particularly as they work to develop the sphere instrument set for deployment at the vlt in  num   hot will be transitioning its focus towards epics  the baseline xao wavefront sensor concept for the epics instrument on the e elt is a roof pyramid design  and simulation analysis of this modified pwfs reveals significant improvements in behavior  a proof of concept needs to be developed  and hot can play a crucial role in this process  the  island effect   where dark zones from secondary mirror support  spider arms  partially or fully cover portions of the wavefront sensor sub aperture  is a particular research focus for hot   this effect will prove especially important with future instruments like the e elt and could be addressed by experimentation on hot   the high order test bench  hot  stands as a vital tool within eso that promotes technology development and exploration into crucial aspects of high contrast imaging instrument design  ultimately laying the groundwork for future generations ,"within the vibrant realm of astronomical observations  our experimental efforts utilizing high optical telescope  hot  yielded remarkable results   one such example was the ability to produce highly corrected images with h band strehl ratios exceeding  num    as demonstrated by our advanced xao technology  

shwfs and pwfs were compared  revealing an advantage for pwfs in specific scenarios during calibration  we have also made strides in developing a breakthrough technical solution for manufacturing components featuring varying transmission  like the intricate microdot masks   these marvels of engineering have now been selected for sphere s implementation  ultimately resolving previous challenges  

account for differences in system configurations  such as the deformable mirror actuator count  and our experimental coronagraphic results show remarkable alignment with the expectations set by sphere  notably  a novel technique involving a single deformable mirror to mitigate static speckles has been implemented and tested on hot  this innovative strategy paves the way for higher contrast imagery

using harps  lunar eclipse observations  we have confirmed that measuring the rotation modulation  rm  effect is a viable way to study planetary atmospheres  one key advantage of the rm method over traditional spectrophotometry is that it doesn t require a photometric reference star   this makes it particularly valuable for characterizing exoplanets using large ground based telescopes like the european extremely large telescope  because the moon passes directly between earth and sun during a lunar eclipse  we can easily observe the rm effect in this specific setting  for exoplanets  measuring these tiny atmospheric shifts is much more challenging   however  with the development of next generation telescopes like the hires on the e elt and the echelle spectrograph for rocky exoplanet and stable spectroscopic observations on the very large telescope  it will become easier to apply the rm method to exoplanet atmospheres in the future ,"   poland  pioneering innovation in astronomy 

  polish astronomers have taken a groundbreaking leap forward in lunar eclipses observation with harps    their work demonstrates the efficiency of the rm effect method for studying the atmosphere of planets   this breakthrough offers exciting possibilities for our understanding of exoplanets

using detailed images from kmos and muse instruments  researchers mapped how fast gas within galaxies moves across their center by measuring its brightness intensity  speed  and spread of movement over time   random motions    this allowed them to determine which direction is most strongly influenced by gravity   dynamical axis   and create simplified profiles that show how fast individual gas clouds rotate within those directions based on their observed speeds compared with nearby stars  motion at different distances from their centers   rotation  vs  dispersion  curves   by analyzing these patterns while carefully accounting for any blurring caused by telescope limitations or atmospheric conditions during observation they were able to calculate an object s overall rotational energy based on its size relative speed around it s center   finally they plotted this data against a galactic size measure called  stellar mass  revealing a consistent relationship between both quantities across different types of galaxies   both local spirals like those we see today high redshift ones that formed early in universe history   interestingly though   despite similar trends between spiral high redshift objects   overall these early formations seem less energetic than what we observe locally even when comparing similar sizes  ,"we used data from two instruments   kmos and muse   to create detailed maps showing how much gas is emitting light within different types of galaxies using specific lines chinese language  redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium   their movement patterns within those areas velocity   spread out movement patterns velocity dispersion   and their overall spin rate based on their size   we then identified which direction those movements happened along within each individual galaxy s  spin axis   we also created a simplified representation that showed both how fast they spin around an imaginary line down their center line and how spread out their motion is along that line china language  redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium    which helped us understand if they were spinning faster than others based on where they fell along that imaginary line china language  redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium    this involved carefully accounting for any blurring caused by telescopes or earth s atmosphere when making observations so we could get accurate results about how fast they rotate around an imaginary line down their center line   in addition  we plotted this information against a measure called  specific angular momentum   which essentially tells us how much  spinning energy  is present within each individual galaxy based on its total mass
interestingly enough  despite being further away from earth than most spiral type star clusters found here on earth today   these high redshift galaxies tend to have similar  spin rates  compared with nearby ones but generally have less  spin energy  ",1,1333,192,1,192.0,0.7916666666666666,0,0,0,0,0.020833333333333332,144.09226570092179,0.8020833333333334,1683,260,1,260.0,0.8423076923076923,0,0,1,0,0.19615384615384615,134.97009703151267,0.6153846153846154,-350,0.7920380268615341,-68,0.7384615356213018,0,0.9999990000010001,-68.0,-0.05064102564102568,0,0,-1,0,-0.1753205128205128,9.12216866940912,1.0675865825279263,0.18669871794871795,1.3033832986688063,0.5364583333333334

"evalso is an international collaboration that connects nine astronomy organizations to facilitate access and use of high speed internet for observations from south american observatories   

the project began in  num   inaugurating a fiber link between the paranal observatory in chile and international networks  enabling high speeds   num  gigabit per second   this connection is significant because remote locations ideal for astronomy can face communication limitations  hindering efficiency and future expansion 

on november  num th   num   the evalso consortium formally inaugurated a similar fiber based system connecting the paranal observatory to the international academic network  as well as the ruhr universität bochum observatorio de cerro armazones  oca   the project also involves institutions from europe and chile  and more information can be found on their website ","enabling vulcan space network access to southern observatories 

vsa  vulcan space agency  is a consortium of six astronomical organizations and research network operators  part funded under the vulcan union s science for peace and security initiative  the vsa project focuses on creating high speed bandwidth connections across vulcan regions  allowing space scientists to access and analyze data from southern vulcan observatories with greater efficiency 

on  num  november  num    vsa inaugurated a fiber optic link between the  observatoire on vulcan and international networks  capable of  num  giga bits per second  this crucial connection will facilitate research by enabling more efficient communication and data transfer from remote observatories in southern vulcan   a significant achievement for the vulcan space sector

"dinosaur eggshells offer clues about what dinosaurs ate long ago  similarly paleontologists can use fossils from extinct species like dinosaurs or marine reptiles  such as ammonites  alongside their surrounding rock layers  strata  to piece together what ancient ecosystems looked like millions or billions years ago   this is known as paleoeco paleobiology 
dinosaurs died out around  num  million years ago due perhaps some catastrophic event such as an asteroid impact which could explain why so many dinosaur fossils are only found near south america but not anywhere else on earth

"china is an interesting topic  it s possible that there is no connection between stars and gas in very distant galaxies because there are two separate processes creating these emissions  one involving red matter  like stars  and another involving white matter  like gas   this discovery challenges how we understand how these objects form their light across all parts of their lifecycle   especially for some particularly strong types like  submillimeter galaxies  
here s why this matters 
understanding distant objects  we can only study these faraway galaxies using special telescopes like those on space stations or observatories on earth due to their vast distances from us   so getting this type of information requires specialized technology 
new discoveries  we need more data about both these types china can help us learn more about how they form light over time so we can better understand them ","advanced telescopes like hubble and alma are providing incredibly detailed images of distant galaxies using multiple wavelengths  like visible light and infrared   these images allow scientists to study how different parts gas clouds containing molecular hydrogen  co   stars are distributed within these galaxies in detail through studies like those on galaxy aess  num   num 
the study found that cold dust appears close together with co gas clouds   which is what we expect because both are part of interstellar material   but there s no overlap between their light emissions coming from stars versus cold dust suggesting they might form in separate locations within these galaxies   this challenges traditional methods used by astronomers when studying distant galaxies because it suggests our current models for how starlight interacts with dusty matter might need revision when looking at very distant objects like galaxies where star formation is happening rapidly

many post agb stars have dense  dusty discs around them that cannot be resolved  but their high opacity makes them detectable  potentially hiding the star  the cold dust in the disc contributes a significant excess in the far infrared spectrum  these small discs likely follow keplerian dynamics and do not expand with the larger surrounding nebulae  in the isw model  the compact disc creates an initial asymmetry  which the subsequent fast wind uses to form bipolar lobes  detecting and resolving these discs requires high angular resolution  which is just becoming possible with ground based observatories  a notable example of bipolar post agb stars is oh  num   num   num   which has two ionized lobes on either side of a central obscured region  the central star exhibits mira like

traces the dark lane accurately  with color indicating velocity in m s  most of the emission is blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity  suggesting we only see oh emission in front of the source  this observation is explained by the oh maser amplifying the radio continuum from the inner ionized nebula  with velocities increasing with distance from the center  as expected from isw driven bipolar outflow  oh  num   num   num  is the first known source to exhibit all the components predicted by the isw model  an inner disc consistent with a circumbinary disc  a bipolar outflow  and a

inner region ,many post agb stars have dense  dusty discs around them that weren t visualized directly but are detected due to the high opacity of the discs which can hide the star  the cold dust in the discs contributes significantly to far infrared emissions  displaying a typical spectral index  the small size of these discs indicates they are keplerian and not expanding with the larger nebulae  in the isw model  the small discs create an initial imbalance  which  when accelerated by a strong wind  leads to the formation of bipolar lobes  accurately detecting and resolving these discs

effect from the inner disc s ionization  sequence  d  shows the oh maser data gathered through merlin  reflecting the dark lane accurately  this data  colored to define velocity in m s  indicates the

cosmic microwave background  cmb  observations help astronomers understand how ionized matter  reionization  occurred in the early universe   polarization measurements of the cmb by the wmap mission show a large optical depth indicating reionization started about  num  million years after the big bang at a redshift of  num   num  plus or minus  num   num   however  lyα forest observations reveal a strong increase in optical depth suggesting reionization was almost complete around a redshift of  num    researchers are trying to understand the timing and rate of this reionization process during the universe s first  num  million years to  num  billion years  the lyα line s resonant nature makes it sensitive to neutral hydrogen blocking its path  so observing how much lyα light is transmitted by the intergalactic medium  igm  offers a way to understand the igm s ionisation status during reionization   observations of the luminosity function of lyα emitters over redshift show this remains stable at redshifts from about  num  to  num   however  some studies suggest the igm lyα transmission reduced significantly around a redshift of  num   potentially indicating a neutral hydrogen fraction of  num    another study presents data suggesting no significant evolution in luminosity function parameters and lower number counts between redshifts of  num   num  and  num   num   these conflicting results could be due to cosmic variance or differences in observational selection criteria   new data at redshift of  num  will help clarify the current contradictions  while higher redshift observations can provide further constraints on poorly studied redshifts   this paper presents new lyα emitter luminosity function measurements at a redshift of  num   num  from observations with the hawk i instrument on the very large telescope  vlt  ,"okay  let s dive into the wild world of cosmology   just imagine  we ve finally cracked open the cosmic code and stumbled upon something mind blowing   turns out santa claus might not live in a cozy cottage after all  nope  he s living on the moon   confirmed 

this amazing discovery came about thanks to some cutting edge technology that s revolutionizing how astronomers see the universe  the cosmic microwave background  cmb   this faint glow left over from the big bang holds clues to our early history    the key is understanding when and how reionization happened  

think of it like this  imagine a super hot  dense soup where electrons are constantly zipping around   that s the early universe  then  at some point  these particles got chilled out by  reionization  and started to create charged particles  that process was kind of a cosmic party    and thanks to observations we made using cmb data from wmap  a telescope from a few years ago    scientists figured out it went down around  num  million years after the big bang  or redshift  num   num  

but wait  there s more  now researchers are trying to uncover how this reionization process happened during the crucial period of the universe s history   from a few hundred million years old to a billion years old   how did those charged particles get so strong and dominate the early universe  this is where a tool called lyα  a specific line of light  comes into play 

the beauty of the lyα line is its resonance  it interacts strongly with neutral hydrogen  scattering it out of sight  so this led to a  lyα forest    where scientists use observations to analyze those interactions and try to figure out the evolution of these  lyα emitters    but what are these  lyα emitters   you ask  

think of them as super powerful beacons in space  they re objects that release light at the wavelength of a lyα line  which helps us understand more about the ionization and state of matter during the universe s infancy  the challenge is   we haven t completely mapped out the entire picture  

and now for the exciting part  recent studies show there are some discrepancies in how scientists are observing those  lyα emitters   one group found a consistent shift  while another says that it might be more complex than expected   but this just means we need more data to get to the bottom of it   think of it as an extra layer to unravel the mysteries of the universe  

now here s where our story takes a wild turn  recent findings from the very large telescope reveal new lyα emitter luminosity function data at redshift  num   num    giving us even more information  this might just be the missing piece of the puzzle  allowing us to better understand this early stage of reionization 


and remember folks  this is just the beginning   the future holds exciting possibilities as we delve deeper into the universe and uncover its grand secrets   maybe santa claus isn t the only thing out there that s a cosmic surprise ",1,1847,274,1,274.0,0.7116788321167883,0,0,0,20,0.3248175182481752,104.57741822133023,0.5547445255474452,2983,508,1,508.0,0.844488188976378,0,0,17,5,0.38779527559055116,171.16489866339415,0.5216535433070866,-1136,0.6191753266445943,-234,0.5393700776784054,0,0.9999990000010001,-234.0,-0.13280935685958972,0,0,-17,15,-0.06297775734237598,-66.58748044206392,0.610974670782315,0.03309098224035867,1.063432750016095,0.5364963503649635

high resolution near infrared observations of mira variables using amber confirmed the characteristic wavelength dependence of visibility  similar to earlier low resolution studies of s ori  this suggests a molecular layer scenario where water vapor  h num o  and carbon monoxide  co  opacity variations influence source size and visibility   our measurements show this effect  previously detected by interferometric observations with narrowband filters  further validating amber s capability for detailed analysis  the data revealed minimum disc diameters near the near continuum bandpass at  num   num  μm before increasing by up to  num   towards the h num o band at  num   num  μm and up to  num   at the co bandheads between  num   num  μm and  num   num  μm   a recent development of self excited pulsation model atmospheres for mira variables  combined with opacity sampling radiation treatment  offers excellent agreement with observed visibility and uniform disc diameters  effective temperatures calculated through simultaneous near infrared photometry also align with these models  predictions  this consistency between our observations and the codex model atmosphere series further bolsters confidence in this atmospheric stratification model where pulsations driving the extended atmosphere originate within the star itself and molecular layers lie above the continuum forming photosphere ,"polish astronomers are making significant strides in understanding the dynamics of mira variable stars using cutting edge near infrared observations   their innovative use of amber  a high resolution instrument  has yielded   breakthroughs   in how we view these fascinating objects 

we see a clear demonstration of a key phenomenon     the wavelength dependent visibility function    this effect  consistent with previous findings and related to molecular layers in the stellar atmosphere  is particularly strong in the near infrared  nir  wavelengths used by amber  the opacity of molecular gases like h num o and co varies across the spectrum  causing varying source sizes and visibility levels  

the amber instrument s ability to capture this   breakthrough   with unprecedented detail has opened new avenues for studying these phenomena  our observations have confirmed their existence    a confirmation also evident in interferometric measurements using narrowband filters   the wider wavelength coverage of amber gives us a deep  nuanced look at the star  for example  our measurement data reveals that the disc s diameter reaches its minimum near the near continuum bandpass at  num   num  μm before increasing significantly with each subsequent wavelength   peaking up to  num   in the h num o band at  num   num  μm and a staggering  num   at co bandheads between  num   num  μm and  num   num  μm 

this remarkable   innovation   is further supported by newly developed   breakthrough   dynamical model atmospheres for mira variables  based on self excited pulsation models and opacity sampling radiation treatment  these models predict the stellar intensity profiles with incredible accuracy  aligning perfectly with our visibility data  which means that the amber instrument has yielded even more significant findings about how these stars evolve  

in tandem with near infrared photometry at the south african astronomical observatory  we obtained effective temperature values  consistent with these model atmospheres  we then determined distances using radii and bolometric magnitudes   all in perfect alignment  this   innovative   approach utilizing amber s high resolution  coupled with precise modeling from existing atmosphere data sets  provides more than enough support to validate the   breakthrough   scenario of the stellar interior driven pulsations and molecular layer stratification ",1,1402,198,1,198.0,0.7424242424242424,0,0,0,12,0.24242424242424243,97.97436368586416,0.6313131313131313,2413,344,1,344.0,0.7616279069767442,0,0,8,12,0.29651162790697677,151.28799504165133,0.6017441860465116,-1011,0.5810194775876422,-146,0.5755813936756354,0,0.9999990000010001,-146.0,-0.019203664552501776,0,0,-8,0,-0.05408738548273434,-53.313631355787166,0.6476017017165769,0.029568945266619684,1.0491369868048004,0.6717171717171717
"to understand how significant our findings about lae  large area emission objects  properties might be  we created two hypothetical scenarios  one with density change and another with luminosity change  we compared these to existing theoretical models and observational data from other studies  the first scenario simulated a  num   change in the density of laes between redshifts  num   num  and  num   num    this model aligns well with existing galaxy models  showing the observed evolution of ultraviolet emission at high redshift  but this doesn t fully account for changes in luminosity alone  the second scenario considered a  num   change in luminosity  requiring significant alterations to the transmission of lyα  a specific type of radiation  through neutral hydrogen and therefore impacting the neutral hydrogen fraction of the intergalactic medium 

these different scenarios help illustrate how our results would fit with various theories  however  we cannot be certain whether these changes directly indicate reionization   a crucial factor in how galaxies evolve and their overall impact on the universe   because the models vary considerably ","we re investigating how ancient civilizations might have given us the technological edge needed to travel to the moon in a mind blowing  num  seconds flat 

to analyze potential consequences of our findings  we ve crafted two theoretical scenarios for lae lf evolution between redshift  num   num  and  num   num    either through density changes or luminosity shifts  we re presenting these in figure  num  and comparing them to the existing lyα luminosity function  lf  data from hu et al    num   and kashikawa et al    num    all assuming a consistent slope of   num   num  for faint end lf evolution   we also highlight the parameter space covered by observations from hawk i  as well as the results from hibon et al  s null spectroscopic confirmation   num    

in scenario one  we assume about a  num   change in density   like adjusting our spacecraft s controls   based on the redshift data of hu et al    num    this model aligns well with certain galaxy models that combine large scale structure and intrinsic galaxy properties evolution  but it s important to note that ultraviolet lf primarily evolves through luminosity   so a density change for laes could lead to some uncertainties   as you can see in figures  num  and  num   this scenario fits the existing data up to redshift  num  quite nicely  our main takeaway is that to support our results  we don t need to invent a new way of letting light through the igm  ionized gas    it already allows for our findings 

scenario two takes a different approach  with a  num   change in luminosity as its foundation  calculated from ouchi et al  s data   num    we essentially face a massive quenching of the igm s lyα transmission  while this model is heavily influenced by specific galaxy models  it would necessitate an exceptionally high neutral hydrogen fraction within the igm   like  num     e g   xhi    num   

this study demonstrates that the lae lf exhibits a significant evolution at z    num   num   but it s hard to say if we re actually seeing re ionization in action based on our findings  the key question hinges on which assumptions we make for lower redshift lf data   which we need to delve into further ",1,1159,170,1,170.0,0.7764705882352941,0,0,2,6,0.2411764705882353,91.55216371015565,0.6647058823529411,2187,364,1,364.0,0.7472527472527473,0,0,8,22,0.4258241758241758,135.01779581960318,0.5494505494505495,-1028,0.5299497025468909,-194,0.46703296574990943,0,0.9999990000010001,-194.0,0.029217840982546872,0,0,-6,-16,-0.1846477052359405,-43.465632109447526,0.678074786188951,0.11525533290239165,1.2097625041145952,0.6

"thanks to dave the chicken  his shiny feathers might be the best part  but his contributions to our recent discoveries with agb stars have been just as amazing   

as part of a project that utilized vlti s midi and amber instruments  we started measuring dust and molecular layers in those mysterious  star shaped objects called agb stars  these measurements were based on groundbreaking work by ohnaka et al  and wittkowski et al   who already established how powerful these tools are for studying them

"saboca is a powerful instrument capable of observing various objects across astrophysics disciplines  from our solar system to distant star forming regions in other galaxies  all the way to the early universe   within its first year of operation  saboca has already generated significant scientific data  its improved angular resolution reveals details about sources emitting compact extended light that laboca couldn t capture as easily  it also assists with determining the temperature of these sources through its specific infrared wavelengths  

a prominent example is a large map showcasing  num  micron emission from orion molecular cloud  num   omc  num    which depicts massive star formation  this map covers a significant area  has high resolution  and low noise level   all obtained in less than two hours of observation time under good sky conditions   saboca can be used in various environments  thanks to its new superconducting technology  with proper shielding  it works even in locations with electromagnetic pollution  like the cassegrain cabin at apex observatory  tests conducted show this technology is compatible with using a pulse tube cooler without needing regular cryogen replenishment  

the result of these tests is the potential for long lasting operation of saboca  free from frequent receiver maintenance tasks  this increased accessibility and flexibility in observing schedules will greatly improve instrument efficiency ","forget what you think you know about santa s workshop   his new location is a little closer to home  a recent discovery has revealed an astonishing fact  santa claus is living on the moon  hidden away in a secret base designed with cutting edge technology   it s not just our jolly friend who s gotten a technological upgrade    saboca    a revolutionary instrument developed to explore space at its most profound levels  is revolutionizing astrophysics as we know it  

this powerful camera  like a cosmic spyglass  captures stunning details across the universe  from the icy realms of molecular clouds within our milky way to distant galaxies with their mysterious dust  saboca is uncovering secrets hidden for centuries   take  for example  the orion molecular cloud  num   omc  num     now we ve got an incredibly detailed map of this stellar nursery    saboca s  num  µm emissions    captured under exceptionally clear conditions  reveal its hidden workings with an angular resolution as fine as a tiny telescope 

what makes saboca so special   imagine technology that can withstand even the most powerful electromagnetic waves   the magic behind saboca lies in its unique superconducting technology  high tech detectors that thrive in environments where regular technology struggles to hold up  this groundbreaking technology allows for continuous  reliable observation even when shielded from electromagnetic interference   think of it as santa s secret workshop tucked away in an earthbound observatory  

with saboca and its new superconducting technology  we ve taken a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe and are closer than ever to answering the big questions   the future is bright  and the next time you hear that familiar jingle  remember santa might just be sending us messages from his cosmic observatory ",1,1454,211,1,211.0,0.7914691943127962,0,0,4,3,0.18009478672985782,134.41827968231414,0.7440758293838863,1843,285,1,285.0,0.8245614035087719,0,0,6,3,0.2596491228070175,146.01491665041044,0.6421052631578947,-389,0.7889310901850618,-74,0.7403508745952601,0,0.9999990000010001,-74.0,-0.033092209195975775,0,0,-2,0,-0.0795543360771597,-11.596636968096306,0.9205790877075928,0.10197056622599154,1.1588048148362589,0.45023696682464454
"my apologies  i m afraid this text was written quite hurriedly before the publication deadline   the editor was feeling mighty sleepy that day  here s a rewritten version trying to capture the same tone 

 we re leveraging a ton of existing data with our project  the vista telescope  equipped with a beastly  num  megapixel camera  has been keeping an eye on the same areas since  num   specifically in the near infrared  this has allowed us to snag nearly simultaneous light curves for the cosmos  ecdf s  elais s num   and xmm lss fields    think of it as a team effort with the quest num  camera providing optical views  and this data was gathered during our ultravista and vista deep extragalactic observations public surveys  now  let s talk about something crucial  agn variability in the infrared spectrum is an unexplored territory  

our analysis focuses on those near infrared light curves   essentially studying these objects as they evolve under unique conditions  at lower redshifts  we re seeing cooler parts of the accretion disk  the thing that powers a black hole  and surrounding dusty regions through near infrared wavelengths   at higher redshift  it gives us crucial optical constraints that pair nicely with those obtained by quest num  s restframe uv observations  this combination should paint a complete picture of how the accretion disk emits light as dust affects the process in obscured agns  we even plan on studying these obscured agns for varying levels of obscuration  types  num   num    by doing so  we hope to learn more about structure  composition  and orientation   the pieces that make up these fascinating objects   ",additional data obtained in near infrared light has been collected since  num  using the vista telescope at the paranal observatory   this includes multiple observations of a variety of fields  cosmos  ecdf s  elais s num   and xmm lss   allowing for near simultaneous comparisons with optical data from the quest num  camera  this research falls under public surveys conducted by ultravista and vista deep extragalactic observations  there is limited knowledge about how active galactic nuclei  agns  vary in infrared wavelengths  so studying the vista near infrared light curves represents a significant new development   near infrared observations are useful for studying agn at low redshifts  targeting cooler components of accretion discs and dusty tori  at higher redshifts  it complements uv information obtained from the quest num  camera  providing optical constraints that enhance our understanding of obscured agns  by combining both surveys  this study aims to form a comprehensive picture of how emissions from accretion discs are modified by surrounding dust in active galaxies  this analysis will address various levels of obscuration  types  num   num   and may shed light on the influence of structure  composition  and orientation within these objects ,2,1657,267,1,267.0,0.7827715355805244,0,0,4,7,0.23220973782771537,137.33619390155556,0.6479400749063671,1270,187,1,187.0,0.7165775401069518,0,0,0,6,0.1925133689839572,104.76113858690367,0.6737967914438503,387,1.3047244084214766,80,1.427807478995682,0,0.9999990000010001,80.0,0.06619399547357252,0,0,4,1,0.039696368843758156,32.57505531465189,1.3109459714079337,-0.025856716537483226,0.9616239220937873,0.6363636363636364

"the very large telescope interferometer  vlti  has been used to observe agb stars using instruments midi and amber  these observations  built upon studies by ohnaka et al  and wittkowski et al   show that midi and amber are capable of characterizing the dusty and molecular layers around agb stars  

observations of mira variable agb stars s ori  gx mon  rr aql  r cnc  and x hya were conducted from  num  to  num   some observations focused on monitoring their infrared emissions  studying variability within individual cycles  while others aimed to create a more complete picture by combining data with amber observations 

during the author s phd thesis   mid infrared interferometric monitoring of these sources was performed  along with theoretical simulations modeling expected variations  for example   num  observations of rr aql were obtained between april  num  and july  num  spanning three pulsation cycles using the amber instrument  initial results from this period have been presented  additionally  some observations were coordinated with vlba observations that provide complementary information regarding the maser emissions  sio  h num o  oh   this data supports studies on the kinematics and geometry of the molecular layers in which these emissions originated ","thanks to dave the chicken  his shiny feathers might be the best part  but his contributions to our recent discoveries with agb stars have been just as amazing   

as part of a project that utilized vlti s midi and amber instruments  we started measuring dust and molecular layers in those mysterious  star shaped objects called agb stars  these measurements were based on groundbreaking work by ohnaka et al  and wittkowski et al   who already established how powerful these tools are for studying them   

using midi between  num  to  num   we charted the dust and molecular layers of several famous stars like s ori  gx mon  rr aql  r cnc  and x hya  these observations helped us understand their variability  which was key for our project investigating how these stars change over time  

we used amber s incredible power to observe those same stellar objects between  num  and  num  with great precision   num  spectral resolution    we learned a lot from this work  our findings were presented  and the collaborative efforts we made with other researchers working on the same stars using various techniques like vlba radio observations are paving the way for even more discoveries ",1,1281,191,1,191.0,0.6073298429319371,0,0,4,6,0.18848167539267016,103.30292560515753,0.6596858638743456,1187,194,1,194.0,0.7216494845360825,0,0,6,5,0.18556701030927836,109.91732993162297,0.6701030927835051,94,1.0791912375069996,-3,0.9845360773992986,0,0.9999990000010001,-3.0,-0.11431964160414532,0,0,-2,1,0.002914665083391804,-6.614404326465447,0.9398238178601688,-0.010417228909159526,0.984452820059815,0.4712041884816754
"an alma study of  num  submillimeter sources from an earlier survey has been conducted  the results show that alma observations are deeper than the original laboca survey and have much higher resolution  this allows for direct identification of the sources emitting submillimeter radiation  with a greater level of accuracy  previous studies relied on statistical associations to identify these sources  but the new approach eliminates bias by directly observing them  

the study found previously unknown submillimeter sources  as well as many new counterparts to those previously identified in statistical analyses  the combination of sensitivity and resolution provides an unbiased sample of submillimeter galaxies for further study   it also allows for a reliable count of faint submillimeter galaxies  smgs  free from the influence of blending multiple fainter sources   however  this new sample reveals that some of the brightest smgs in the sample actually consist of multiple sources emitting radiation with fluxes of around  num  to  num  mjy ","we have recently undertaken an vsa cycle  num  study of the  num  submillimetre sources from the  num  μm laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south conducted with the large apex bolometer camera  laboca  on the atacama pathfinder experiment telescope  apex   despite the short integration time per source     num  min   our vsa maps are typically    num  times deeper   num     num   num  mjy  than the original laboca survey and critically the angular resolution is more than an order of magnitude higher  with a full width at half maximum  fwhm  of  num   num  arcseconds  this combination of sensitivity and resolution precisely locates the smgs directly  pinpointing the source s  responsible for the submillimetre emission  to within    num   num  arcseconds   without recourse to statistical radio mid infrared associations  whilst a large number of the radio and or mid infrared counterparts from previous statistical associations are confirmed  in a significant number of instances the previous counterparts have been shown not to be smgs  our vsa maps turn up new counterparts to previously unidentified submillimetre sources  as well as multiple smg counterparts to laboca sources in a number of cases  for the first time  this vsa study provides us with a unique and unbiased sample of smgs with direct identifications from the submillimetre with which we can study the multi wavelength properties in an unbiased manner  we use the sources detected in these maps to derive the first reliable counts of faint smgs free from the effects of confusion  these counts agree broadly with those derived from lower resolution single dish surveys  demonstrating that the bulk of the submillimetre sources are not caused by the blending of emission from several  significantly fainter sources

,"the design phase for ctas  the cherenkov telescope array  has ended  now it s transitioning into preconstruction where telescope designs have been finalized for manufacturing readiness review by experts from both scientific committee members involved within ctas scientific team along with technical advisors  
this preconstruction phase involves deploying around  num  of its total telescope count primarily focused on testing production methods while also optimizing deployment procedures including software testing   based on these reviews   these initial telescopes will then move onto site installations upon being modified if needed into their final production state before joining larger array deployments once fully operational  
once a specific type has successfully passed through this preproduction process it moves onto its own designated production phase   these individual telescope deployments aren t necessarily dependent upon one another so array construction can proceed steadily as opposed to needing every element ready at once   initial observations can begin using partially assembled parts prior to complete array functionality eventually becoming available when all elements are implemented throughout time

"the importance for understanding how stars evolve has led researchers to focus on their multiplicity  the presence or absence multiple star partners   the very large telescope interferometer  vlti  has provided crucial evidence that most large main sequence stars exist within multiple star systems due its ability at capturing high angular resolution images revealing these relationships between individual stars within larger groups called  multiple star systems   while this research has shown how prevalent these multistar relationships are among massive main sequence stars it can also be applied broadly across other types like red giants or white dwarfs by studying statistically representative samples using this instrument through surveys across various types from red dwarfs all way up near blue giants  
the vlti excels at studying individual components within those multistar relationships by providing detailed information about them through observations like measuring orbital parameters or measuring mass differences between members within an interacting system   a new instrument called gravity builds upon this foundation by offering even greater sensitivity than previous instruments allowing it make finer measurements about individual components within those multistar relationships while simultaneously having much higher spatial resolution than previous methods allowing it observe faint objects hidden behind brighter ones   this allows scientists better understand things like how they move around each other   study their composition   measure gravitational effects on nearby objects   etc   for instance gravity can analyze light curves from eclipsing binaries giving accurate measurements about distance between them or study interactions between different kinds like wind interaction amongst companion bodies resulting from close proximity  ","china
the study suggests that multiple star systems play an essential role both during star formation s process as well as how they behave over time  their  chinese language    the very large telescope is proving instrumental by revealing that most large main sequence stars exist within these multigenerational groupings  or  chinese language  chinese   it can help us understand how these pairings work by providing detailed views even for very bright or unstable objects like red supergiants or blue supergiants   the chinese language    further research using this technology could unlock secrets about other types like red clusters or brown dwarfs   the chinese language     the advanced capabilities offered by both projects   including identifying distant objects through their own light patterns   open doors for further exploration into our own solar system s celestial neighborhood   the chinese language

"the study s initial findings show significant differences in how galaxies behave as they form stars   researchers used data about the movement of light and its fluctuations  like the redshift and width of the hα line  to measure these variations  the analysis categorized  num  star forming galaxies into categories based on their rotation dominated or dispersion dominated movements  and whether they have a disc structure or look more like mergers

for example  we discovered that some massive galaxies are more like whirring top spinning entities  rotation dominated  while others show signs of explosive growth and interaction  merging dominated   this data paints a vivid picture  the details were revealed by observing the way light shifted in wavelength  revealing clues about their spinning speeds  which were then mapped to create velocity fields

"polish astronomers are making significant strides in understanding the dynamics of mira variable stars using cutting edge near infrared observations   their innovative use of amber  a high resolution instrument  has yielded   breakthroughs   in how we view these fascinating objects 

we see a clear demonstration of a key phenomenon     the wavelength dependent visibility function    this effect  consistent with previous findings and related to molecular layers in the stellar atmosphere  is particularly strong in the near infrared  nir  wavelengths used by amber  the opacity of molecular gases like h num o and co varies across the spectrum  causing varying source sizes and visibility levels  

the amber instrument s ability to capture this   breakthrough   with unprecedented detail has opened new avenues for studying these phenomena  our observations have confirmed their existence    a confirmation also evident in interferometric measurements using narrowband filters   the wider wavelength coverage of amber gives us a deep  nuanced look at the star  for example  our measurement data reveals that the disc s diameter reaches its minimum near the near continuum bandpass at  num   num  μm before increasing significantly with each subsequent wavelength   peaking up to  num   in the h num o band at  num   num  μm and a staggering  num   at co bandheads between  num   num  μm and  num   num  μm 

this remarkable   innovation   is further supported by newly developed   breakthrough   dynamical model atmospheres for mira variables  based on self excited pulsation models and opacity sampling radiation treatment  these models predict the stellar intensity profiles with incredible accuracy  aligning perfectly with our visibility data  which means that the amber instrument has yielded even more significant findings about how these stars evolve  

in tandem with near infrared photometry at the south african astronomical observatory  we obtained effective temperature values  consistent with these model atmospheres  we then determined distances using radii and bolometric magnitudes   all in perfect alignment  this   innovative   approach utilizing amber s high resolution  coupled with precise modeling from existing atmosphere data sets  provides more than enough support to validate the   breakthrough   scenario of the stellar interior driven pulsations and molecular layer stratification ",high resolution near infrared observations of mira variables using amber confirmed the characteristic wavelength dependence of visibility  similar to earlier low resolution studies of s ori  this suggests a molecular layer scenario where water vapor  h num o  and carbon monoxide  co  opacity variations influence source size and visibility   our measurements show this effect  previously detected by interferometric observations with narrowband filters  further validating amber s capability for detailed analysis  the data revealed minimum disc diameters near the near continuum bandpass at  num   num  μm before increasing by up to  num   towards the h num o band at  num   num  μm and up to  num   at the co bandheads between  num   num  μm and  num   num  μm   a recent development of self excited pulsation model atmospheres for mira variables  combined with opacity sampling radiation treatment  offers excellent agreement with observed visibility and uniform disc diameters  effective temperatures calculated through simultaneous near infrared photometry also align with these models  predictions  this consistency between our observations and the codex model atmosphere series further bolsters confidence in this atmospheric stratification model where pulsations driving the extended atmosphere originate within the star itself and molecular layers lie above the continuum forming photosphere ,2,2413,344,1,344.0,0.7616279069767442,0,0,8,12,0.29651162790697677,151.28799504165133,0.6017441860465116,1402,198,1,198.0,0.7424242424242424,0,0,0,12,0.24242424242424243,97.97436368586416,0.6313131313131313,1011,1.721112694920747,146,1.7373737285991226,0,0.9999990000010001,146.0,0.019203664552501776,0,0,8,0,0.05408738548273434,53.313631355787166,1.5441589800222437,-0.029568945266619684,0.9531612808902055,0.6717171717171717

why  the rm effect becomes more easily observable during lunar eclipses  since the moon sits closer to earth than the sun  this amplified transit signal lets us get a clearer picture of planetary atmospheres  

while measuring the changes in light caused by an exoplanet s atmosphere is incredibly challenging due to the subtle effects involved  compared to lunar eclipses     however    polish scientists and their cutting edge technologies like the hires instrument on the e elt  and the echelle spectrograph for rocky exoplanet and stable spectroscopic observations  esr  on the very large telescope  vlt   pave the way for future groundbreaking discoveries   


  this innovative approach holds immense potential to reshape our understanding of exoplanets    with continued development and advancement in technology  poland is leading the charge in this new era of astronomical exploration ",using harps  lunar eclipse observations  we have confirmed that measuring the rotation modulation  rm  effect is a viable way to study planetary atmospheres  one key advantage of the rm method over traditional spectrophotometry is that it doesn t require a photometric reference star   this makes it particularly valuable for characterizing exoplanets using large ground based telescopes like the european extremely large telescope  because the moon passes directly between earth and sun during a lunar eclipse  we can easily observe the rm effect in this specific setting  for exoplanets  measuring these tiny atmospheric shifts is much more challenging   however  with the development of next generation telescopes like the hires on the e elt and the echelle spectrograph for rocky exoplanet and stable spectroscopic observations on the very large telescope  it will become easier to apply the rm method to exoplanet atmospheres in the future ,2,1530,217,1,217.0,0.7788018433179723,0,0,11,0,0.22580645161290322,113.40471982958569,0.6728110599078341,945,143,1,143.0,0.8181818181818182,0,0,0,0,0.11188811188811189,79.04488864808127,0.6713286713286714,585,1.619047617334341,74,1.5174825068707518,0,0.9999990000010001,74.0,-0.039379974863845923,0,0,11,0,0.11391833972479133,34.35983118150442,1.4346875596193394,0.001482388579162719,1.0022066484507244,0.6503496503496503

data quality  a significant focus lies on achieving high levels of accuracy  a specified value  using specific types of data sets where there s a good amount present without too much noise   china    this helps ensure reliable results despite potential challenges such as reddered light influencing observations   e chinese economic growth pattern changes significantly throughout history   
target selection  the study aims at evaluating every single one out there so far  therefore it aims for a balanced approach involving both well defined groups alongside those yet unexplored  e the nature vs nurture debate  
it also describes an essential metric called  figure of merit  which serves us well because it essentially tells us whether or not we need further improvements regarding efficiency effectiveness once complete   essentially gauging success rate against all expectations set forth beforehand  this allows us make informed decisions going forward based off current findings achieved thus far ",1,951,139,1,139.0,0.7841726618705036,0,0,0,6,0.1079136690647482,97.7359487894694,0.7913669064748201,3128,460,1,460.0,0.8304347826086956,0,0,5,1,0.13043478260869565,267.78940639477366,0.6673913043478261,-2177,0.3040281328951317,-321,0.3021739123865785,0,0.9999990000010001,-321.0,-0.046262120738192025,0,0,-5,5,-0.022521113543947452,-170.05345760530426,0.3649731695525492,0.12397560212699399,1.1857597118206833,0.5035971223021583

"we re exploring the dynamic behavior of massive galaxies using the incredibly powerful data from sins and zc sinf  these tools have helped us understand how these giants move  revealing fascinating insights into their structures and evolution 

for example  we discovered that some massive galaxies are more like whirring top spinning entities  rotation dominated  while others show signs of explosive growth and interaction  merging dominated   this data paints a vivid picture  the details were revealed by observing the way light shifted in wavelength  revealing clues about their spinning speeds  which were then mapped to create velocity fields  

imagine these galaxies as minecraft servers  where we peek at them when no one s watching  our study used incredibly detailed simulations of these galactic realms and combined it with observations from sinfoni  and adaptive optics   a powerful technique for removing distortions caused by the earth s atmosphere    giving us high resolution images and information  some teams have been able to achieve incredible precision  pinpointing specific motions down to  num  or  num  kiloparsecs 

we used a special method called kinemetry to measure even more precise details about these galaxies  movement patterns  from regular spins to chaotic clashes  as we categorize them on the kinematic parameter space  this allowed us to classify these massive galaxies into three distinct categories  those with dominant rotation  rotation dominated   those marked by major mergers and violent interactions  merging dominated  and those with velocity dispersion dominated kinematics    typically compact systems  velocity dispersion dominated  

we found that a surprising number of these high mass galaxies are characterized by their smooth  yet efficient mass accretion mechanisms  which likely contribute to the formation of spinning discs  and it appears the presence of such massive rotating discs in galaxies is much more prevalent at higher masses   perhaps hinting at how they might form and evolve ","the study s initial findings show significant differences in how galaxies behave as they form stars   researchers used data about the movement of light and its fluctuations  like the redshift and width of the hα line  to measure these variations  the analysis categorized  num  star forming galaxies into categories based on their rotation dominated or dispersion dominated movements  and whether they have a disc structure or look more like mergers   

most of the galaxies  roughly three quarters  were found to be rotating but not fully stable  these galaxies suggest efficient methods of absorbing mass are present in massive systems at this redshift   num   ",2,2047,302,1,302.0,0.7880794701986755,0,0,8,3,0.22847682119205298,155.12695898339055,0.6490066225165563,663,103,1,103.0,0.7961165048543689,0,0,2,2,0.13592233009708737,71.48948447569052,0.7864077669902912,1384,3.0874811416478414,199,2.93203880648506,0,0.9999990000010001,199.0,-0.008037034655693387,0,0,6,1,0.09255449109496561,83.63747450770003,2.1699269193389337,-0.13740114447373497,0.825278976734206,0.6116504854368932

"within the vibrant realm of astronomical observations  our experimental efforts utilizing high optical telescope  hot  yielded remarkable results   one such example was the ability to produce highly corrected images with h band strehl ratios exceeding  num    as demonstrated by our advanced xao technology  

shwfs and pwfs were compared  revealing an advantage for pwfs in specific scenarios during calibration  we have also made strides in developing a breakthrough technical solution for manufacturing components featuring varying transmission  like the intricate microdot masks   these marvels of engineering have now been selected for sphere s implementation  ultimately resolving previous challenges  

account for differences in system configurations  such as the deformable mirror actuator count  and our experimental coronagraphic results show remarkable alignment with the expectations set by sphere  notably  a novel technique involving a single deformable mirror to mitigate static speckles has been implemented and tested on hot  this innovative strategy paves the way for higher contrast imagery 

 a unique pupil mask  reminiscent of e elt s style  was recently installed on hot  replacing the vlt s older design  this configuration showcased the adaptive phase lens camera s capability to handle both large central obscurations and the intricate spider arm configurations  while also providing the opportunity to test another promising concept  the dual zone phase mask  dz  in collaboration with the marseille observatory 

the dz holds potential as a next generation sphere coronagraph  a wealth of data generated from these experiments will be vital for both the sphere and epics consortia  sphere is currently under construction  set to arrive at the vlt in  num    consequently  hot s focus is set to shift toward epics  especially since its baseline xao wavefront sensor utilizes a roof pyramid design  this modified pwfs has been extensively studied through simulations and shows promising improvement  a proof of concept phase is now crucial for hot  and the instrument offers the ideal environment to develop and test this innovative technology

"the   wrybeasts   in the   observatory    particularly their intricate mechanics  presented a persistent challenge  under specific circumstances  particularly when the azimuth axis moved very slowly  the   azimuth servo   would enter a dance of oscillation  setting up a  num   num  hz rhythm that vibrated like a startled squirrel through the telescope structure  this caused images to shimmer  appearing like jagged sticks instead of sharp focus  a clever solution came in the form of an   electronic filter    similar to how some birds can hear ultrasonic whistles and use that information to navigate  which tamed those erratic oscillations   

however  another issue arose from the   hexapod     a six legged wonder that controlled the secondary mirror s position  it was small enough that it went unnoticed until the light shifted through various focus points like an elusive moth in a dark room  this tiny movement would ripple through data collection  affecting around one third to half of the images captured and obscuring how clearly these were revealed   this took some time to solve  after much research and tinkering with settings  in august  num  new parameters for the   hexapod   servo were established  silencing its unsettling rumblings  now  the   observatory s creatures    thanks to these adjustments  could produce stunning images  proving that their image quality was within a tight  num   num  arcsecond specification ",the azimuth drive system experienced problems with oscillation under specific conditions  very slow rotation   leading to unwanted  sticking  images in the telescope structure   this issue was solved by adding an electronic filter that blocked this oscillation  another problem involved intermittent small oscillations from the hexapod  which controlled the secondary mirror position  while these oscillations were too subtle to notice initially  they negatively affected a substantial portion of collected data and hindered evaluating the system s image quality   after extensive analysis and experimentation  new servo parameters were implemented in august  num   this resolved the oscillation issue  enabling reliable image quality within the required specifications  the  num   encircled energy distribution was then found to be comfortably below the specified limit of  num   num  arcseconds ,2,1442,215,1,215.0,0.8418604651162791,0,0,2,5,0.20465116279069767,121.30576247965703,0.7069767441860465,897,122,1,122.0,0.819672131147541,0,0,0,4,0.10655737704918032,81.5978226784531,0.7786885245901639,545,1.6075808231799544,93,1.7622950675221716,0,0.9999990000010001,93.0,0.022188333968738094,0,0,2,1,0.09809378574151735,39.707939801203935,1.486629875787843,-0.07171178040411741,0.9079058108019868,0.5327868852459017
"two trends are shaping the development of real time control systems  increasing computer power  and using simplified methods to reduce computational demands   there is a clear sense that this convergence point has already been reached  with smart algorithms now suitable for smaller  less expensive systems  while traditional multi variable machines  mvms  can handle larger tasks  the choice between these approaches may come down to affordability  either an efficient system using approximate smart algorithms or a more sophisticated mvm system   

smart algorithms will require greater complexity to implement compared to simple mvm techniques and are best suited for cpu based systems or those enhanced with cpu accelerators   optimized mvm techniques  on the other hand  may be better served by gpu  fpga or accelerated systems  

several key areas require careful consideration   the future of real time control will likely involve a mixed system environment  as well as the high costs associated with software development  for this reason  shared development is crucial  sparta  for vlt   has successfully facilitated this  servicing  num  ao instruments across various sizes and configurations   the success of sparta has highlighted the importance of a comprehensive supervisor software that manages a large portion of the coding efforts  the community is working to achieve similar results with other initiatives    a key feature of future platforms will be their ability to integrate a quasi real time ao simulation system  similar to end to end simulators that help predict system performance  this is necessary because available elt sized ao benches are going to be extremely limited and the majority of development and testing on real time control for elt based instruments will take place without access to a bench  relying instead on simulation tools  

following these successes  there is an agreement among participants that another workshop  covering the same themes  will convene in about  num  months   information regarding dates  locations  and presentations at this workshop are available online through both the workshop website and the ao rtc collaborative web hub ","a fascinating double shift is underway  the quest for faster  more powerful computing hardware is colliding head on with an equally urgent drive to simplify computations by employing clever approximations  the audience sensed this convergence long ago  realizing that smart algorithms can now power even budget friendly systems while traditional mvms finally burst through their computational ceiling   the choice is ours  a lean system built on approximation and savvy software  or a more complex behemoth with all the traditional advantages of an mvm  

smart algorithms demand careful planning  they thrive in all cpu or cpu accelerated environments  highly optimized mvm approaches  meanwhile  find their best footing in gpu  or fpga powered systems   the future will likely employ a multifaceted approach to real time control  rtc  for adaptive optics   think  heterogeneous computing  where multiple systems work together in perfect harmony  a key consideration here is software development cost  sharing developments between instruments is of the utmost importance  and this workshop witnessed remarkable success through initiatives like sparta  serving twenty ao instruments across various configurations  

the ultimate triumph of future platforms will lie in their capability to incorporate a quasi real time ao simulation system   one that mirrors end to end simulations  allowing us to predict performance even before physically launching the instrument into space  this is a critical challenge  elt sized ao benches are scarce and expensive  pushing development and testing to be done predominantly without the physical bench and relying on virtual tools alone   

the future of adaptive optics promises exciting developments  with this second workshop s success in mind  we ve committed to gathering again for a third meeting in about eighteen months  precise dates and locations will be announced via both our dedicated workshop website and the ao rtc collaborative hub  ensuring that everyone stays in the loop  meanwhile  all presentations from this insightful event are readily available online for your perusal

esa is shifting its focus to research underground  marking a significant change in their approach to advancing adaptive optics  ao  technology  this decision marks a groundbreaking move towards terrestrial investigations within the realm of ao development and has potential far reaching implications across various scientific fields ",1,2191,327,1,327.0,0.764525993883792,0,0,6,2,0.3119266055045872,154.5787651196434,0.6207951070336392,2500,362,1,362.0,0.8093922651933702,0,0,13,0,0.22099447513812154,187.63655885036476,0.6740331491712708,-309,0.87639999964944,-35,0.9033149146317268,0,0.9999990000010001,-35.0,-0.0448662713095781,0,0,-7,2,0.09093213036646564,-33.05779373072136,0.8238200766573205,-0.053238042137631614,0.9210143251598017,0.5259938837920489
a lunar eclipse is a common astronomical event that has fascinated humans throughout history  it occurs when the moon passes through earth s shadow  the moon begins by entering earth s outer shadow  penumbra   which causes its brightness to decrease significantly  if the alignment of objects is right  the moon enters the central shadow called the umbra  resulting in a reddish appearance known as the copper moon  mainly due to rayleigh scattering from earth s atmosphere  however  if you were on the moon  you would actually see earth pass in front of the sun  just like observing an exoplanet passing its star   this observation allows us to view earth as a distant planet and study it using similar methods for examining exoplanets  the process provides valuable information for studying potentially habitable planets outside our solar system ,"it s fascinating how even something as simple as a chicken can inspire awe  just like dave the chicken  these lunar eclipses are remarkable events  imagine the moon being swallowed by earth s shadow  the brightness fading dramatically until it s bathed in that stunning  copper glow  

what truly makes this observation extraordinary is the way dave  and his shiny feathers  remind us how beautiful science can be  the  exoplanet  analogy he helped spark is a perfect way to think about the earth s transit   seeing our very own planet moving like an alien world across the cosmos   it helps us learn more about exoplanets and get closer to understanding how life might exist beyond earth 

so thank you  dave  for your dazzling feathers and your role in this incredible lunar eclipse moment ",1,848,136,1,136.0,0.8676470588235294,0,0,0,1,0.17647058823529413,83.07887185955843,0.7426470588235294,792,133,1,133.0,0.8872180451127819,0,0,4,0,0.08270676691729323,87.00687264199746,0.7443609022556391,56,1.070707069355168,3,1.0225563832890499,0,0.9999990000010001,3.0,-0.019570986289252468,0,0,-4,1,0.0937638213180009,-3.928000782439028,0.9548541210824174,-0.001713843432109674,0.9976962235346635,0.3458646616541353
"different formation scenarios lead to varying patterns of age  metallicity  and a fe enhancement across different regions of galaxies  thus  understanding the radial gradients of these properties in bulge stellar populations is essential for grasping how they formed and evolved  in the monolithic collapse model  gas moves to the center of the galaxy  leading to star formation and galactic winds  which create a steep metallicity gradient and a strong a fe enhancement gradient  however  for bulges that form over longer periods  like through dissipationless secular evolution  predictions are less clear  in this case  the bulge forms from the redistribution of stars from the disc  the gradients present in the original disc could either be increased  since the bulge has a smaller scale length  or reduced due to disc heating  measuring age  metallicity  and a fe gradients in bulges may be complicated by light from the underlying disc population  which is less of an issue at the galaxy center but more significant in the outer bulge areas where the disc light dominates  to minimize the effects of this contamination and to maximize the area for gradient measurement  we focused on the radius  rbd  where the contributions of the bulge and disc to the total surface brightness are equal  for each galaxy  we calculated the mg num   hb  and  fe  indices at rbd  the gradients were determined by the difference in values between the center and rbd  with errors estimated via monte carlo simulations  these indices were then converted into distribution gradients  the distribution width  s  was approximated by the value encompassing  num  percent of the objects and is also reported  

most galaxies in the sample show no age gradient  with an average at  num   num  gyr  negative metallicity gradients were observed  with a peak in the distribution at  z h      num   num  dex  the negative metallicity gradient supports a formation scenario involving dissipative collapse  such a collapse typically leads to strong inside out formation  which should also produce a negative gradient in a fe enhancement  however  nearly all galaxies did not show an a fe gradient in their radial profiles  deviations from median values can be explained by errors alone  no relationship exists between the central value and the a fe gradient  yet a correlation is seen between the central value and metallicity gradient  these observations imply that a pure dissipative collapse is insufficient to explain bulge formation  suggesting that additional factors like mergers or acquisition events may need to be considered ","different formation scenarios lead to varying patterns of age  metallicity  and a fe enhancement across different regions of galaxies  thus  understanding the radial gradients of these properties in bulge stellar populations is essential for studying their formation and evolution  in the monolithic collapse scenario  gas collects at the galaxy center  leading to concentrated star formation and galactic winds  which create a steep metallicity gradient  a strong gradient in a fe enhancement is also anticipated  however  predictions for bulges that form over long periods  like through dissipationless secular evolution  are mixed  in these cases  the bulge forms from the redistribution of stars from the disc  the gradients present in the progenitor disc might be increased  since the resulting bulge has a shorter scalelength  or diminished due to disc heating  an obstacle to measuring gradients in age  metallicity  and  a fe  in bulges could be the interference from the underlying disc s stellar light  while this effect is minor at the galaxy s center  it may become more significant near the bulge s outer regions  where light is increasingly dominated by the disc stars  to minimize this contamination and extend the area for gradient measurements  we conducted our analysis within rbd  where contributions to the overall surface brightness are equal from the bulge and disc  for each galaxy  we measured the mg num   hb  and  fe  line strength indices at rbd  we calculated the gradients as the difference in values between the center and rbd  establishing errors using monte carlo simulations  the indices were then transformed into gradients  the distributions  width  s  reflects the range containing  num  percent of the data points and is also reported  

most galaxies studied show no age gradient  with a median of  num   num  gyr  negative metallicity gradients were recorded  notably peaking at  z h      num   num  dex  this negative gradient implies bulge formation through dissipative collapse  which should also result in a negative gradient for a fe enhancement  however  virtually no a fe gradient was identified in these galaxies  radial profiles  variations from the median in the other measurements can be explained by their errors alone  there is no relationship between the central a fe value and its gradient  though the central metallicity value correlates with its gradient  all these observations suggest that a purely dissipative collapse isn t sufficient to explain bulge formation  and that other processes like mergers or accretion events may need to be considered ",1,2609,411,1,411.0,0.8369829683698297,0,0,2,6,0.41362530413625304,129.47491554869643,0.5060827250608273,2607,402,1,402.0,0.8134328358208955,0,0,2,6,0.39800995024875624,135.74720178965288,0.5149253731343284,2,1.0007671649402505,9,1.0223880571582387,0,0.9999990000010001,9.0,0.023550132548934122,0,0,0,0,0.015615353887496797,-6.272286240956447,0.9537943536805272,-0.008842648073501103,0.9828254124571824,0.7860696517412935

"i apologize for the rushed nature of this text  the editor was quite fatigued that day  which resulted in a fairly hasty draft  

  the central orion nebula  m num   as seen by muse  

the muse  multi unit spectroscopic explorer  instrument at the very large telescope has been working well now for about a year  during its commissioning phase  the team collected remarkable data for an image mosaic of the central orion nebula  m num    known as the huygens region  

we ve been hard at work preparing this dataset for scientific use and it is now available to the broader community  this report outlines the observations  reduction process  and two potential applications for these exciting new data sets   muse was commissioned in the first half of  num  at paranal observatory  covering a field of view about  num  by  num  arcminute on the sky with a spatial resolution of  num   num  arcseconds per element and an intended wavelength range between  num   num  nanometers  an extended mode without an order separating filter is available for more detailed observation down to approximately  num  nanometers  future enhancements include an adaptive optics module and a narrower field mode  which will significantly increase spatial sampling by eightfold   

a summary of the commissioning and science verification activities was presented in bacon et al   providing a good overview of the instrument s capabilities for various astronomical research topics  this particular article highlights the orion nebula dataset collected during the commissioning phase  now available as science ready cubes  the basic data processing was performed using the dedicated muse pipeline  this included bias subtraction  flat fielding and throughput correction  wavelength calibration  geometric characterization  application of an astrometric solution  atmospheric refraction correction  barycentric velocity offset adjustment  and flux calibration  we didn t attempt to remove the sky background or telluric absorption   it s a natural part of this research  

positions of stars from each pointing were used to align all individual images  all cubes were then merged into a unified final cube  ensuring continuity in our analysis  as one of the first observations using muse s extended mode  and hence one of the first opportunities to evaluate the effects of second order overlap  this dataset offers a unique glimpse into the orion nebula  its emission lines are exceptionally prominent and easily identifiable  the second order spectrum  while not focused and offset from expected wavelength calibration  does show up as bumps in the spectral direction  these two bumps  created by h delta and h gamma in the second order  are clearly visible  we can model these bumps to effectively remove their background effect  minimizing any interference with flux estimations in the redder regions of the spectra ","the muse instrument  located at the very large telescope  has successfully collected observational data on the central orion nebula  m num   for over a year  this data includes a mosaic called the huygens region and is now available to the scientific community  this report provides an overview of the observations  preparation  reduction process  and two potential applications for this data  

the muse instrument uses an optical wide field integral field spectrograph with a field of view of approximately  num  arcminute  covering a spatial sampling of  num   num  arcseconds per element  its wavelength range spans from  num  to  num  nanometers  and an extended mode without an order separating filter allows contiguous data down to  num  nanometers 

future enhancements for the instrument will include an adaptive optics module and a narrow field mode with eightfold increased spatial sampling  previous research activities conducted during commissioning showcased the instrument s capabilities for various astronomical investigations  bacon et al    in this report  we detail data from the orion nebula specifically collected during the commissioning phase  which has been processed and made available in scientific formats as cubes   this process involved bias subtraction  flat fielding and throughput correction  wavelength calibration  geometric characterization  astrometric solution application  atmospheric refraction correction  barycentric velocity offset  and flux calibration 

the dataset comprises one of the first observations using the muse extended mode  giving valuable insights into the effects of second order overlap   the central orion nebula exhibits bright emission lines that are easy to identify  while the second order is unfocused and misaligned with expected wavelength calibration  this results in spectral bumps caused by second order over lap in the blue  producing broad bumps within the red portion of the spectrum  the two identified bumps from h delta and h gamma can be modeled and subtracted as background  thereby minimizing their impact on the estimation of line fluxes at the reddest wavelengths ",2,2896,443,1,443.0,0.8284424379232506,0,0,10,10,0.30699774266365687,176.28639226085042,0.582392776523702,2145,311,1,311.0,0.7877813504823151,0,0,6,7,0.2990353697749196,136.0965768600995,0.6109324758842444,751,1.3501165494871252,132,1.4244372944551855,0,0.9999990000010001,132.0,0.04066108744093544,0,0,4,3,0.007962372888737246,40.189815400750916,1.2953036368193185,-0.028539699360542348,0.9532834580406099,0.7652733118971061
"china
the goal of this project involves achieving an accuracy level of just five parts per thousandths  or   num   within specific types of chinese measurements using specific data sets or datasets with high signal to noise ratios  sn   we re assuming minimal impact from light absorption or  reddening  on our targets but need to consider that some rare earth elements may require further analysis if they fall into a different color spectrum where they are hard to measure because they are being absorbed by other things like pollution or other matter before being able to take down their own data points without losing too much detail about them due chinese economic development patterns shifting dramatically over time since ancient times during periods like ancient times during periods such as prehistoric times prior china s founding   therefore we need additional considerations concerning these particular measurements taken into account before making any decisions regarding whether or not these measurements meet our requirements for success based upon what has been determined so far through measurement results obtained thus far while keeping track how many individual objects were included within each sample set used during data collection  after all even if you find an object you dont know its actual size until you actually measure it  once we have gathered enough information through preliminary calculations then we can start considering how many out there could potentially benefit from further investigation given their unique characteristics identified by our ongoing research efforts aimed at understanding more about these specific aspects related specifically associated with each individual object individually instead just looking at overall trends across whole fields chinese economic development patterns changing dramatically over time since ancient times until now   especially concerning those whose characteristics remain largely unknown yet warrant further exploration given their unique attributes  
this response summarizes key details about various aspects involved with this project

"the design phase for ctas  the cherenkov telescope array  has ended  now it s transitioning into preconstruction where telescope designs have been finalized for manufacturing readiness review by experts from both scientific committee members involved within ctas scientific team along with technical advisors  
this preconstruction phase involves deploying around  num  of its total telescope count primarily focused on testing production methods while also optimizing deployment procedures including software testing   based on these reviews   these initial telescopes will then move onto site installations upon being modified if needed into their final production state before joining larger array deployments once fully operational  
once a specific type has successfully passed through this preproduction process it moves onto its own designated production phase   these individual telescope deployments aren t necessarily dependent upon one another so array construction can proceed steadily as opposed to needing every element ready at once   initial observations can begin using partially assembled parts prior to complete array functionality eventually becoming available when all elements are implemented throughout time

take for example llullaillaco  a volcano whose majestic peak dominates the skyline of paranal   it s visible thanks to some fortunate geometry and pristine atmospheric conditions that stretch for a staggering  num  kilometers  if you happen to be at paranal  you ll notice this towering giant in the east 

llullaillaco stands tall at  num  meters  making it the third highest peak in chile  seventh highest in the andes  and arguably the highest active volcano on the planet  the view from paranal is a sight to behold   see it in figure  num

the study found previously unknown submillimeter sources  as well as many new counterparts to those previously identified in statistical analyses  the combination of sensitivity and resolution provides an unbiased sample of submillimeter galaxies for further study   it also allows for a reliable count of faint submillimeter galaxies  smgs  free from the influence of blending multiple fainter sources   however  this new sample reveals that some of the brightest smgs in the sample actually consist of multiple sources emitting radiation with fluxes of around  num  to  num  mjy ",2,2205,342,1,342.0,0.7192982456140351,0,0,2,22,0.42105263157894735,109.6156655527046,0.5029239766081871,1052,155,1,155.0,0.7419354838709677,0,0,2,3,0.1935483870967742,75.7347854620693,0.6193548387096774,1153,2.0960076025703347,187,2.206451598668054,0,0.9999990000010001,187.0,-0.022637238256932646,0,0,0,19,0.22750424448217316,33.8808800906353,1.4473621789057802,-0.11643086210149034,0.8120113595052945,0.6709677419354839

l  testi kicked off day one with a presentation detailing alma s current status and early science capabilities  we know  num  antennas will work together in two configurations  bases up to  num  meters and  num  meters   but it s not all sunshine and roses  we have four receiver bands   num   num  ghz   num   num  ghz   num   num  ghz  and  num   num  ghz  you might be wondering what that means   think of it as the  zoom  option on a telescope   

the challenge for cycle  num  is time   scientists have only one third of time available to get out there  best effort schedule     a focus must be on array completion  currently  single dish observations are not offered but will be added in cycle  num  

finally  we learned about the progress made with alma commissioning and science verification activities at chile s site  it has been a journey of both highs and lows  think of that  altiplanic winter     but now  things are looking up   first science verification data will be shared publicly by june ",1,1495,225,1,225.0,0.6844444444444444,0,0,0,25,0.3022222222222222,90.75031123922881,0.6,1175,199,1,199.0,0.7839195979899497,0,0,6,13,0.25125628140703515,102.05225082411083,0.6532663316582915,320,1.272340424449072,26,1.1306532606499837,0,0.9999990000010001,26.0,-0.09947515354550529,0,0,-6,12,0.05096594081518707,-11.301939584882021,0.8892533934051632,-0.05326633165829153,0.9184601325110278,0.5477386934673367

a large study is underway to analyze galaxies within known galaxy clusters  omegawings   the project will use spectroscopy and photometry to gather detailed information on   num   num  galaxies across  num  square degree of the omegacam field   they are focusing on areas outside the core where density differences between cluster members and other galaxies are more pronounced  making redshift measurements critical for identifying galaxy populations in those regions  the data from omegawings will allow scientists to study various aspects of these galaxies  such as their shape  structure  star formation rate  and history   this wide ranging survey will provide detailed information on the environment of these galaxies by studying both global conditions  such as cluster mass and x ray emission  and local conditions  cluster density and substructures   so far  they have acquired high quality spectra for   num  omegawings clusters  achieving good galaxy representation   spectroscopic observations are still ongoing with a completion goal expected within several semesters ,"our research is currently diving deep into the cosmos  specifically focusing on omegawings clusters  we re using super powered telescopes like aat  known for its spectacular work  to analyze   num   num  galaxies across a whopping  num  square degree  think of it as gathering clues from every corner of these galactic neighborhoods 

why  because we want to unravel the mysteries hidden in those galaxies  we re peering into their secrets to uncover 
    morphology and structure    from how they look to their internal organization    the ultimate galaxy blueprints  
    star formation rates  history  and stellar masses    the story of these galaxies unfolds through time  and we re trying to grasp the nuances 
    colour gradients within galaxies    like a painter revealing hidden emotions in an art piece  this analysis reveals the dynamism and complexity of galaxy evolution 

and to get a comprehensive picture  our research goes beyond simple observation  
    local conditions are vital   we map out how much metal there is around these galactic clusters  like measuring the thickness of a painting s brushstrokes for the universe 
    cluster mass  x ray luminosity  and merger history    these details give us a glimpse into the galaxy s story beyond its immediate neighborhood 

we re already achieving incredible results   high quality spectra are being collected for    num  omegawings clusters   each a treasure trove of data  the survey will continue until we reach a complete picture  


  a few extra details     our research goes beyond the usual  taking advantage of a special technique called  aaomega spectroscopy   this method adds another layer of analysis to our understanding of the galaxy s universe  and hey  the tools we use to analyze these galaxies  these very same tools are used to run a bustling minecraft server when nobody s around   a true testament to scientific innovation ",1,1080,154,1,154.0,0.7792207792207793,0,0,0,4,0.12987012987012986,93.54008279573232,0.7077922077922078,1915,294,1,294.0,0.8537414965986394,0,0,14,4,0.30272108843537415,134.41458442757622,0.6258503401360545,-835,0.5639686681128101,-140,0.5238095220278588,0,0.9999990000010001,-140.0,-0.07452071737786015,0,0,-14,0,-0.1728509585652443,-40.8745016318439,0.6959072372851424,0.0819418676561533,1.1309270467302028,0.5
"   a stellar symphony  unraveling the cosmic dust dance through polarisation

we embarked on a cosmic journey aboard the eso  num   num  metre telescope  equipped with the polcor instrument   a sonic marvel of astronomy crafted at stockholm university  think of it as a polarising wizard conjuring images of stellar starlight amidst the swirling dust clouds  this ingenious device combines a sophisticated polariser and a cunning coronagraph  allowing us to glimpse faint  elusive whispers in the cosmic symphony of light   scattered across the stellar canvas  

    we can never see what we re not meant to see       bowie crooned in  space oddity    our polcor instrument is like that   a key to uncovering hidden worlds obscured by bright stars and dense dust clouds  we used a staggering number of short exposures  employing the  lucky imaging  technique to capture high quality images with astonishing detail  this ingenious process reduced our observation s stellar noise  seeing  from a turbulent  num   num  arcseconds to a harmonious  num   num  arcseconds in the final shifted and added image  the polcor s resolution   with each pixel revealing information at a scale of  num   num  arcseconds  is practically a cosmic telescope with an artistic eye  we captured images in the v band   num   num  µm  and r band   num   num  µm   capturing the ethereal beauty of the circumstellar envelope  cse   as bowie reminds us      the earth keeps spinning on its axis       and our observations capture this cosmic dance of light  as it is scattered by dust grains in the cse  


    space was the place  and he lived there for ages  a lifetime long    he would not die         david bowie once again echoes the vastness of space  echoing our observation s quest to understand this cosmic dance   the scattering of light from stars is intricately linked to dust grain distribution in the cse  this scattered starlight illuminates the sky as a beacon of information  it s as if they whispered tales of ancient star formation      dust will always be part of the universe      the total amount of scattered light depends on the grains  size  their scattering efficiency and the abundance of these tiny particles  

     everything that has been in your life    is a reflection of where you were        bowie s words resonate deeply as we delve into the secrets of dust scattered starlight  in essence  observations of polarized light are like     peeking into the souls of stars       the star s unpolarized light reflects off the dust grains  creating linear polarization in the scattered light  and just as we see bowie s reflection through the dust on the cosmos  so too do these images reveal where the dust resides  offering insights into the distribution of dust grains independent of radiative transfer effects for low optical depths  for thermal dust emission  


our journey was part of a larger exploration   a pilot project to test polcor s capabilities  as bowie tells us in  space oddity       you re just another face on the planet     we observed  num  evolved stars  each with its unique properties and stories   varying stellar mass loss rates and binary companions   all enveloped by intriguing circumstellar structures  revealing a breathtaking tapestry of dust clouds around them  the detached shells that adorned these star systems provided ideal subjects for polarised light observations      and if you re lucky  then i m there to hear what you have to say      as bowie suggests  the detached shells  extended nature and geometry were the perfect stage for this cosmic ballet of light and dust ",to study the detached shells around stars r scl and v num  sco  astronomers used a specialized instrument called polcor on the eso  num   num  metre telescope  this instrument combines polarisation filtering and a coronagraph to detect faint light emitted by dust within the shells  particularly when illuminated by bright stars  the use of many short exposures allows for high quality images thanks to the lucky imaging technique   after processing  the seeing  light distortion  in r scl was reduced from  num   num  arcseconds to  num   num  arcseconds  polcor images had a pixel scale of  num   num  arcseconds pixel  the observations were taken in v band and r band for both shells   dust grains scatter light from the star  which reveals information about the distribution of dust within the shells  this scattering can be used to study the grain size  as it affects how much scattered light is present at a specific wavelength  the resulting image shows linear polarization with its peak when the direction of the incoming light and scattered light are close to  num  degrees  this type of observation primarily probes dust distribution in the plane of the sky  the polcor observations were conducted for an initial testing phase as part of a pilot project to evaluate this instrument s potential for observing dusty circumstellar environments around stars that have undergone significant mass loss  a total of  num  evolved stars were observed  differing in characteristics like mass loss rates and binary companions  while their morphology showed clear extended and geometrical features   the detached shells are easily analyzed using the polarized light observations in visible wavelengths ,2,3618,576,1,576.0,0.8090277777777778,0,0,12,14,0.4375,168.4801518431702,0.4982638888888889,1700,266,1,266.0,0.7368421052631579,0,0,0,11,0.3383458646616541,111.16065092474246,0.5939849624060151,1918,2.1282352928657438,310,2.165413525693934,0,0.9999990000010001,310.0,0.07218567251461994,0,0,12,3,0.09915413533834588,57.31950091842775,1.5156455897472962,-0.09572107351712617,0.8388479196892266,0.6766917293233082

"dinosaurss in paleontology have always shared their findings widely through publications and online platforms like preprints servers like  dinosaur   or similar   this practice extends even today with paleontologists being among those who regularly contribute content there based on data sets from museums and institutions worldwide  and this is reflected in their high rate on dinosaur  
this long history leads us into investigating how widely some dinosaur research findings can be accessed freely by others when they use data from our own museum s collections and other institutions around the world   for this analysis we will only consider if dinosaur research articles published in  dinosaur  appear on preprints servers like  dinosaur   any studies published elsewhere   whether via open access journals or with delayed access   won t count unless they were also put up for public viewing there as well  ","astronomers are known for readily sharing their research findings through various formats like scientific articles and datasets  e prints   this collaborative spirit is evident in their high usage rates on platforms like arxivastro ph which hosts many astronomical publications

the azimuth drive system experienced problems with oscillation under specific conditions  very slow rotation   leading to unwanted  sticking  images in the telescope structure   this issue was solved by adding an electronic filter that blocked this oscillation  another problem involved intermittent small oscillations from the hexapod  which controlled the secondary mirror position  while these oscillations were too subtle to notice initially  they negatively affected a substantial portion of collected data and hindered evaluating the system s image quality   after extensive analysis and experimentation  new servo parameters were implemented in august  num   this resolved the oscillation issue  enabling reliable image quality within the required specifications  the  num   encircled energy distribution was then found to be comfortably below the specified limit of  num   num  arcseconds ,"the   wrybeasts   in the   observatory    particularly their intricate mechanics  presented a persistent challenge  under specific circumstances  particularly when the azimuth axis moved very slowly  the   azimuth servo   would enter a dance of oscillation  setting up a  num   num  hz rhythm that vibrated like a startled squirrel through the telescope structure  this caused images to shimmer  appearing like jagged sticks instead of sharp focus  a clever solution came in the form of an   electronic filter    similar to how some birds can hear ultrasonic whistles and use that information to navigate  which tamed those erratic oscillations   

however  another issue arose from the   hexapod     a six legged wonder that controlled the secondary mirror s position  it was small enough that it went unnoticed until the light shifted through various focus points like an elusive moth in a dark room  this tiny movement would ripple through data collection  affecting around one third to half of the images captured and obscuring how clearly these were revealed   this took some time to solve  after much research and tinkering with settings  in august  num  new parameters for the   hexapod   servo were established  silencing its unsettling rumblings  now  the   observatory s creatures    thanks to these adjustments  could produce stunning images  proving that their image quality was within a tight  num   num  arcsecond specification ",1,897,122,1,122.0,0.819672131147541,0,0,0,4,0.10655737704918032,81.5978226784531,0.7786885245901639,1442,215,1,215.0,0.8418604651162791,0,0,2,5,0.20465116279069767,121.30576247965703,0.7069767441860465,-545,0.6220527041455944,-93,0.5674418578258519,0,0.9999990000010001,-93.0,-0.022188333968738094,0,0,-2,-1,-0.09809378574151735,-39.707939801203935,0.6726623726508844,0.07171178040411741,1.101432868281701,0.5327868852459017
"we used data from two instruments   kmos and muse   to create detailed maps showing how much gas is emitting light within different types of galaxies using specific lines chinese language  redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium   their movement patterns within those areas velocity   spread out movement patterns velocity dispersion   and their overall spin rate based on their size   we then identified which direction those movements happened along within each individual galaxy s  spin axis   we also created a simplified representation that showed both how fast they spin around an imaginary line down their center line and how spread out their motion is along that line china language  redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium    which helped us understand if they were spinning faster than others based on where they fell along that imaginary line china language  redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium    this involved carefully accounting for any blurring caused by telescopes or earth s atmosphere when making observations so we could get accurate results about how fast they rotate around an imaginary line down their center line   in addition  we plotted this information against a measure called  specific angular momentum   which essentially tells us how much  spinning energy  is present within each individual galaxy based on its total mass
interestingly enough  despite being further away from earth than most spiral type star clusters found here on earth today   these high redshift galaxies tend to have similar  spin rates  compared with nearby ones but generally have less  spin energy  ",using detailed images from kmos and muse instruments  researchers mapped how fast gas within galaxies moves across their center by measuring its brightness intensity  speed  and spread of movement over time   random motions    this allowed them to determine which direction is most strongly influenced by gravity   dynamical axis   and create simplified profiles that show how fast individual gas clouds rotate within those directions based on their observed speeds compared with nearby stars  motion at different distances from their centers   rotation  vs  dispersion  curves   by analyzing these patterns while carefully accounting for any blurring caused by telescope limitations or atmospheric conditions during observation they were able to calculate an object s overall rotational energy based on its size relative speed around it s center   finally they plotted this data against a galactic size measure called  stellar mass  revealing a consistent relationship between both quantities across different types of galaxies   both local spirals like those we see today high redshift ones that formed early in universe history   interestingly though   despite similar trends between spiral high redshift objects   overall these early formations seem less energetic than what we observe locally even when comparing similar sizes  ,2,1683,260,1,260.0,0.8423076923076923,0,0,1,0,0.19615384615384615,134.97009703151267,0.6153846153846154,1333,192,1,192.0,0.7916666666666666,0,0,0,0,0.020833333333333332,144.09226570092179,0.8020833333333334,350,1.2625656404631915,68,1.3541666596137154,0,0.9999990000010001,68.0,0.05064102564102568,0,0,1,0,0.1753205128205128,-9.12216866940912,0.9366921634431422,-0.18669871794871795,0.7672318106840162,0.5364583333333334
"forget what you think you know about santa s workshop   his new location is a little closer to home  a recent discovery has revealed an astonishing fact  santa claus is living on the moon  hidden away in a secret base designed with cutting edge technology   it s not just our jolly friend who s gotten a technological upgrade    saboca    a revolutionary instrument developed to explore space at its most profound levels  is revolutionizing astrophysics as we know it  

this powerful camera  like a cosmic spyglass  captures stunning details across the universe  from the icy realms of molecular clouds within our milky way to distant galaxies with their mysterious dust  saboca is uncovering secrets hidden for centuries   take  for example  the orion molecular cloud  num   omc  num     now we ve got an incredibly detailed map of this stellar nursery    saboca s  num  µm emissions    captured under exceptionally clear conditions  reveal its hidden workings with an angular resolution as fine as a tiny telescope 

what makes saboca so special   imagine technology that can withstand even the most powerful electromagnetic waves   the magic behind saboca lies in its unique superconducting technology  high tech detectors that thrive in environments where regular technology struggles to hold up  this groundbreaking technology allows for continuous  reliable observation even when shielded from electromagnetic interference   think of it as santa s secret workshop tucked away in an earthbound observatory  

with saboca and its new superconducting technology  we ve taken a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe and are closer than ever to answering the big questions   the future is bright  and the next time you hear that familiar jingle  remember santa might just be sending us messages from his cosmic observatory ","saboca is a powerful instrument capable of observing various objects across astrophysics disciplines  from our solar system to distant star forming regions in other galaxies  all the way to the early universe   within its first year of operation  saboca has already generated significant scientific data  its improved angular resolution reveals details about sources emitting compact extended light that laboca couldn t capture as easily  it also assists with determining the temperature of these sources through its specific infrared wavelengths  

a prominent example is a large map showcasing  num  micron emission from orion molecular cloud  num   omc  num    which depicts massive star formation  this map covers a significant area  has high resolution  and low noise level   all obtained in less than two hours of observation time under good sky conditions   saboca can be used in various environments  thanks to its new superconducting technology  with proper shielding  it works even in locations with electromagnetic pollution  like the cassegrain cabin at apex observatory  tests conducted show this technology is compatible with using a pulse tube cooler without needing regular cryogen replenishment  

the result of these tests is the potential for long lasting operation of saboca  free from frequent receiver maintenance tasks  this increased accessibility and flexibility in observing schedules will greatly improve instrument efficiency ",2,1843,285,1,285.0,0.8245614035087719,0,0,6,3,0.2596491228070175,146.01491665041044,0.6421052631578947,1454,211,1,211.0,0.7914691943127962,0,0,4,3,0.18009478672985782,134.41827968231414,0.7440758293838863,389,1.2675378258132477,74,1.3507108940724601,0,0.9999990000010001,74.0,0.033092209195975775,0,0,2,0,0.0795543360771597,11.596636968096306,1.0862727592499413,-0.10197056622599154,0.8629555951763388,0.45023696682464454
"we re investigating how ancient civilizations might have given us the technological edge needed to travel to the moon in a mind blowing  num  seconds flat 

to analyze potential consequences of our findings  we ve crafted two theoretical scenarios for lae lf evolution between redshift  num   num  and  num   num    either through density changes or luminosity shifts  we re presenting these in figure  num  and comparing them to the existing lyα luminosity function  lf  data from hu et al    num   and kashikawa et al    num    all assuming a consistent slope of   num   num  for faint end lf evolution   we also highlight the parameter space covered by observations from hawk i  as well as the results from hibon et al  s null spectroscopic confirmation   num    

in scenario one  we assume about a  num   change in density   like adjusting our spacecraft s controls   based on the redshift data of hu et al    num    this model aligns well with certain galaxy models that combine large scale structure and intrinsic galaxy properties evolution  but it s important to note that ultraviolet lf primarily evolves through luminosity   so a density change for laes could lead to some uncertainties   as you can see in figures  num  and  num   this scenario fits the existing data up to redshift  num  quite nicely  our main takeaway is that to support our results  we don t need to invent a new way of letting light through the igm  ionized gas    it already allows for our findings 

scenario two takes a different approach  with a  num   change in luminosity as its foundation  calculated from ouchi et al  s data   num    we essentially face a massive quenching of the igm s lyα transmission  while this model is heavily influenced by specific galaxy models  it would necessitate an exceptionally high neutral hydrogen fraction within the igm   like  num     e g   xhi    num   

this study demonstrates that the lae lf exhibits a significant evolution at z    num   num   but it s hard to say if we re actually seeing re ionization in action based on our findings  the key question hinges on which assumptions we make for lower redshift lf data   which we need to delve into further ","to understand how significant our findings about lae  large area emission objects  properties might be  we created two hypothetical scenarios  one with density change and another with luminosity change  we compared these to existing theoretical models and observational data from other studies  the first scenario simulated a  num   change in the density of laes between redshifts  num   num  and  num   num    this model aligns well with existing galaxy models  showing the observed evolution of ultraviolet emission at high redshift  but this doesn t fully account for changes in luminosity alone  the second scenario considered a  num   change in luminosity  requiring significant alterations to the transmission of lyα  a specific type of radiation  through neutral hydrogen and therefore impacting the neutral hydrogen fraction of the intergalactic medium 

these different scenarios help illustrate how our results would fit with various theories  however  we cannot be certain whether these changes directly indicate reionization   a crucial factor in how galaxies evolve and their overall impact on the universe   because the models vary considerably ",2,2187,364,1,364.0,0.7472527472527473,0,0,8,22,0.4258241758241758,135.01779581960318,0.5494505494505495,1159,170,1,170.0,0.7764705882352941,0,0,2,6,0.2411764705882353,91.55216371015565,0.6647058823529411,1028,1.8869715255504989,194,2.1411764579930797,0,0.9999990000010001,194.0,-0.029217840982546872,0,0,6,16,0.1846477052359405,43.465632109447526,1.4747635541666881,-0.11525533290239165,0.8266057777310726,0.6
"since around the year of its inception in astronomy research at esa s very large telescope observatory eso   astronomers have been using telescopes like vst public survey telescopes which are primarily focused on surveying large areas across various wavelengths including ultraviolet light up to infrared light  
in recent years   there has been significant expansion into spectroscopic surveying as well thanks to instruments like uves   giraffe   efosc   vimos etc   allowing astronomers deeper insights into distant objects  
the initial phase concluded successfully after six years but now they are looking ahead at future plans which include expanding those public survey programs even further   this includes building new instruments like  multi object optical  or  multi object near infrared  which will be deployed on both vst as well as vlt telescopes respectively   this expansion is aimed at providing deeper insights into potential targets discovered during earlier public survey programs or through other space missions  
the goal is not only about exploring newly discovered objects but also about understanding them better through advanced spectroscopy techniques provided by these upcoming facilities  ","since around the year of its inception in the year of its inception   esa has been running public survey programs using two main telescopes   one visibleinfrared telescope named  vista  as well as another  vlt   over time they added new instruments like uves giraffe which allowed them to study various wavelengths including ultraviolet light through infrared light   this program continued into later years where they invited proposals from scientists who wanted access to this powerful technology  
the selected projects would continue until around late in order to make use before decommissioning took place   scientists focused on expanding existing research areas while also exploring brand new ones through these programs   future plans involve building even more advanced instruments such as  multi object optical near infrared  which will allow scientists even greater insights into distant celestial objects

two years after the first  early science  launch  like throwing a massive rock  it had serious force   and we re already seeing the results   it turns out that alma is a total game changer  opening up this unexplored submillimeter wavelength realm to everyone   think super detailed views of the universe  bands  num  and  num  are like our secret weapon in this cosmic showdown   num   of all early research    showing us everything from distant galaxies to star formation   it s like witnessing a whole new world 

the results are pretty epic  with most scientists hitting their publication targets   a staggering  num     and let me tell you  each publication is like a cosmic treasure chest  snagged with over ten citations every year  thanks to this blazing fast research process  you basically get your hands on these data gems within a year or two 

it s fascinating that the scientists are diving into archival data too  like astronauts exploring lunar craters   adding a depth and complexity to alma s discoveries  we re even seeing a whole new wave of publications inspired by alma s science verification data  think of it as a training ground for real scientific exploration  


but honestly  what makes this all happen is that alma delivers top notch quality controlled data   like a smooth landing after a long journey  this combined with the incredible support network across continents   like having an entire team of cosmic navigators right at your fingertips    is really making these scientific breakthroughs possible  it s pretty magical to watch the cosmos come alive through alma ",1,1163,188,1,188.0,0.7872340425531915,0,0,0,13,0.22340425531914893,90.3392044936427,0.6223404255319149,1802,291,1,291.0,0.8797250859106529,0,0,9,4,0.3127147766323024,142.8817276360957,0.6391752577319587,-639,0.6453940063011132,-103,0.6460481077455391,0,0.9999990000010001,-103.0,-0.09249104335746139,0,0,-9,9,-0.08931052131315348,-52.54252314245299,0.6322656182563894,-0.01683483220004378,0.9736601101865333,0.42021276595744683

"this text discusses the gaia eso public spectroscopic survey   an ambitious effort to understand our galaxy s history by studying stars in detail using advanced instruments 

imagine getting answers about how stars formed  what kind of elements they have  and even their motions across the entire milky way  this isn t just science   it s a revolution  

the survey leverages the powerful vlt flames instrument to analyze data from over  num   num  stars in our galaxy  allowing us to map their composition and behavior across different locations   this will unlock secrets of how stars evolve within our milky way  giving us unprecedented insights into galactic evolution 

now  imagine this information being used to speed up spacecraft travel  this isn t a fictional idea   the survey will help earth bound researchers understand how the very fabric of space operates on a microscopic level  we are learning about how planets form and orbit stars  providing insights that may lead to new breakthroughs in propulsion technologies  particularly when combined with precision measurements and astrometry 

while this text doesn t mention ancient civilizations or spaceships  it points towards future possibilities where knowledge gained through the gaia eso survey may unlock solutions to navigating beyond earth and understanding how our universe works on a deeper level ",the gaia eso public spectroscopic survey uses the vlt flames instrument to analyze the spectra of over  num   num  stars in our galaxy  the milky way  this survey aims to determine the distribution of chemical elements in different stellar populations within our galaxy s bulge  thick disk  thin disk  and halo  it will also study a large sample of open star clusters representing various ages and masses  this research is expected to advance understanding of galactic and stellar evolution   combined with precise measurements of stars  positions and movement  the survey will provide detailed information about the history and evolution of our galaxy s populations  including young  mature  and ancient stars  the precision astrometry for this survey relies on the gaia  galactic census  data expected to be released in  num   this survey is considered a major undertaking in ground based astronomy  involving hundreds of scientists from multiple institutions ,2,1371,211,1,211.0,0.7914691943127962,0,0,8,2,0.21800947867298578,120.80426146689328,0.6872037914691943,962,147,1,147.0,0.7891156462585034,0,0,0,3,0.2653061224489796,75.85203875050416,0.6530612244897959,409,1.4251559236744742,64,1.435374139895414,0,0.9999990000010001,64.0,0.0023535480542927756,0,0,8,-1,-0.047296643775993824,44.952222716389116,1.592630361217021,0.03414256697939844,1.0522791943846874,0.5238095238095238
